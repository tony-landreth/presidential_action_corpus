        <h1 id="h-1">Blocking Property and Suspending Entry of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="12747">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (NEA), the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=113&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=278&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 113-278</a>) (the ``Venezuela Defense of Human Rights Act'') (the ``Act''), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=8&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1182&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1182</a>(f)) (INA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="12747">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the situation in Venezuela, including the Government of Venezuela's erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, use of violence and human rights violations and abuses in response to antigovernment protests, and arbitrary arrest and detention of antigovernment protestors, as well as the exacerbating presence of significant public corruption, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I hereby order:</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="12747">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong> (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:</p>
        (i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and
        (ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:
        (A) to be responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, or to have participated in, directly or indirectly, any of the following in or in relation to Venezuela:
        (1) actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions;
        (2) significant acts of violence or conduct that constitutes a serious abuse or violation of human rights, including against persons involved in antigovernment protests in Venezuela in or since February 2014;
        (3) actions that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or peaceful assembly; or
        (4) public corruption by senior officials within the Government of Venezuela;
        (B) to be a current or former leader of an entity that has, or whose members have, engaged in any activity described in subsection (a)(ii)(A) of this section or of an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order;
        (C) to be a current or former official of the Government of Venezuela;
        (D) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of:

        (2) an activity described in subsection (a)(ii)(A) of this section; or
        (E) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
        <p id="p-17" data-page="12748">(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="12748">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in subsection 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons, except where the Secretary of State determines that the person's entry is in the national interest of the United States. This section shall not apply to an alien if admitting the alien into the United States is necessary to permit the United States to comply with the Agreement Regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations, signed at Lake Success June 26, 1947, and entered into force November 21, 1947, or other applicable international obligations.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="12748">
          <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="12748">
          <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="12748">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and </p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="12748">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
        <p id="p-23" data-page="12748">
          <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 6.</strong> For the purposes of this order:</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="12748">(a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;</p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="12748">(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="12748">(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;</p>
        <p id="p-29" data-page="12748">(d) the term ``Government of Venezuela'' means the Government of Venezuela, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Venezuela, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Venezuela.</p>
        <p id="p-30" data-page="12748">
          <strong>Sec. 7.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual.
