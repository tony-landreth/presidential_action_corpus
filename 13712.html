        <p id="p-2" data-page="73633">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the situation in Burundi, which has been marked by the killing of and violence against civilians, unrest, the incitement of imminent violence, and significant political repression, and which threatens the peace, security, and stability of Burundi, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.

        <p id="p-23" data-page="73634">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in subsection 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>
        <p id="p-24" data-page="73634">

        <p id="p-25" data-page="73634">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="73634">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and </p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="73634">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="73634">
          <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-29" data-page="73634">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-30" data-page="73634">
          <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
        <p id="p-31" data-page="73634">(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</p>
        <p id="p-32" data-page="73634">(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and</p>
        <p id="p-33" data-page="73634">(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.</p>
        <p id="p-34" data-page="73634">
          <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="73635"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-73635" data-page="73635" data-text="Start Printed Page 73635" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 73635}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 73635</span></span></span>or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-35" data-page="73635">
          <strong>Sec. 8</strong>. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-36" data-page="73635">
          <strong>Sec. 9</strong>. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine that circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property of a person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take necessary action to give effect to that determination.</p>
        <p id="p-37" data-page="73635">
          <strong>Sec. 10</strong>.
