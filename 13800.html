        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13800">Executive Order 13800</a> of May 11, 2017
        <h1 id="h-1">Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="22391">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to protect American innovation and values, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="22391">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Cybersecurity of Federal Networks</em>. </p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="22391">(a) <em>Policy</em>. The executive branch operates its information technology (IT) on behalf of the American people. Its IT and data should be secured responsibly using all United States Government capabilities. The President will hold heads of executive departments and agencies (agency heads) accountable for managing cybersecurity risk to their enterprises. In addition, because risk management decisions made by agency heads can affect the risk to the executive branch as a whole, and to national security, it is also the policy of the United States to manage cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise. </p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="22391">(b) <em>Findings</em>.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-5" data-page="22391">(i) Cybersecurity risk management comprises the full range of activities undertaken to protect IT and data from unauthorized access and other cyber threats, to maintain awareness of cyber threats, to detect anomalies and incidents adversely affecting IT and data, and to mitigate the impact of, respond to, and recover from incidents. Information sharing facilitates and supports all of these activities.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-6" data-page="22391">(ii) The executive branch has for too long accepted antiquated and difficult-to-defend IT.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-7" data-page="22391">(iii) Effective risk management involves more than just protecting IT and data currently in place. It also requires planning so that maintenance, improvements, and modernization occur in a coordinated way and with appropriate regularity. </p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-8" data-page="22391">(iv) Known but unmitigated vulnerabilities are among the highest cybersecurity risks faced by executive departments and agencies (agencies). Known vulnerabilities include using operating systems or hardware beyond the vendor's support lifecycle, declining to implement a vendor's security patch, or failing to execute security-specific configuration guidance.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-9" data-page="22391">(v) Effective risk management requires agency heads to lead integrated teams of senior executives with expertise in IT, security, budgeting, acquisition, law, privacy, and human resources.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="22391">(c) <em>Risk Management</em>.</p>

        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-11" data-page="22391">(i) Agency heads will be held accountable by the President for implementing risk management measures commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that would result from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of IT and data. They will also be held accountable by the President for ensuring that cybersecurity risk management processes are aligned with strategic, operational, and budgetary planning processes, in accordance with chapter 35, subchapter II of title 44, United States Code. <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="22392"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-22392" data-page="22392" data-text="Start Printed Page 22392" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 22392}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 22392</span></span></span>
