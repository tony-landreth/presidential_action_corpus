                Executive Order 13012 of July 18, 1996

                
Establishing an Emergency Board To Investigate a 
                Dispute
                 Between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
                Authority and Their Employees Represented by the
                Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers

                A dispute exists between the Southeastern Pennsylvania 
                Transportation Authority and its employees represented 
                by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.

                The dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the 
                provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 
                U.S.C. 151 et seq.)(the ``Act'').

                A party empowered by the Act has requested that the 
                President establish an emergency board pursuant to 
                section 9A of the Act (45 U.S.C. 159a).

                Section 9A(c) of the Act provides that the President, 
                upon such request, shall appoint an emergency board to 
                investigate and report on the dispute.

                NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as 
                President, by the Constitution and the laws of the 
                United States, including Section 9A of the Act, it is 
                hereby ordered as follows:

                Section 1. Establishment of the Board. There is 
                established effective July 19, 1996, a Board of three 
                members to be appointed by the President to investigate 
                this dispute. No member shall be pecuniarily or 
                otherwise interested in any organization of railroad 
                employees or any carrier. The Board shall perform its 
                functions subject to the availability of funds.

                Sec. 2. Report. The Board shall report to the President 
                with respect to the dispute within 30 days of its 
                creation.

                Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by Section 
                9A(c) of the Act, from the date of the creation of the 
                Board and for 120 days thereafter, no change, except by 
                agreement of the parties, shall be made by the carrier 
                or the employees in the conditions out of which the 
                dispute arose.

                Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of 
                the Board are records of the Office of the President 
                and upon the Board's termination shall be maintained in 
                the physical custody of the National Mediation Board.

                Sec. 5. Expiration. The Board shall terminate upon 
                submission of the report provided for in section 2 of 
                this order.

                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,

                     July 18, 1996.
