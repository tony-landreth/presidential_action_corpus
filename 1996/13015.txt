                Security

                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States, 
                including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, 
                it is hereby ordered as follows:

                Section 1. Establishment. There is established the 
                White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security 
                (the ``Commission''). The Commission shall consist of 
                not more than 25 members, to be appointed by the 
                President from the public and private sectors, each of 
                whom shall have experience or expertise in some aspect 
                of aviation safety or security. The Vice President 
                shall serve as the Chair of the Commission.

                Sec. 2. Functions. (a) The Commission shall advise the 
                President on matters involving aviation safety and 
                security, including air traffic control.

                    (b) The Commission shall develop and recommend to 
                the President a strategy designed to improve aviation 
                safety and security, both domestically and 
                internationally.
                    (c) The Chair may, from time to time, invite 
                experts to submit information to the Commission; hold 
                hearings on relevant issues; and form committees and 
                teams to assist the Commission in accomplishing its 
                objectives and duties, which may include individuals 
                other than members of the Commission.

                Sec. 3. Administration. (a) The heads of executive 
                departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted 
                by law, provide the Commission such information with 
                respect to aviation safety and security as the 
                Commission requires to fulfill its functions.

                    (b) The Commission shall be supported, both 
                administratively and financially, by the Department of 
                Transportation and such other sources (including other 
                Federal agencies) as may lawfully contribute to 
                Commission activities.

                Sec. 4. General. (a) I have determined that the 
                Commission shall be established in compliance with the 
                Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 
                App. 2). Notwithstanding any other Executive order, the 
                functions of the President under the Federal Advisory 
                Committee Act, as amended, shall be performed by the 
                Secretary of Transportation in accordance with the 
                guidelines and procedures established by the 
                Administrator of General Services, except that of 
                reporting to the Congress.

                    (b) The Commission shall exist for a period of 6 
                months from the date of this order, unless extended by 
                the President.

                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,

                     August 22, 1996.
