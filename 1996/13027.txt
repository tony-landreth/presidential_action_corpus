                Executive Order 13027 of November 15, 1996

                
Establishing an Emergency Board To Investigate a 
                Dispute Between the Southeastern Pennsylvania 
                Transportation Authority and Its Employees Represented 
                by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers

                A dispute exists between Southeastern Pennsylvania 
                Transportation Authority and certain of its employees 
                represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.

                The dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the 
                provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 
                U.S.C. 151 et seq.) (the ``Act'').

                A party empowered by the Act has requested that the 
                President establish a second emergency board pursuant 
                to section 9A of the Act (45 U.S.C. 159a).

                Section 9A(e) of the Act provides that the President, 
                upon such request, shall appoint a second emergency 
                board to investigate and report on the dispute.

                NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as 
                President, by the Constitution and the laws of the 
                United States, including section 9A of the Act, it is 
                hereby ordered as follows:

                Section 1. Establishment of the Board. There is 
                established effective 12:01 a.m., eastern standard 
                time, on November 16, 1996, a board of three members to 
                be appointed by the President to investigate this 
                dispute. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise 
                interested in any organization of railroad employees or 
                any carrier. The board shall perform its functions 
                subject to the availability of funds.

                Sec. 2. Report. Within 30 days after creation of the 
                board, the parties to the dispute shall submit to the 
                board final offers for settlement of the dispute. 
                Within 30 days after submission of final offers for 
                settlement of the dispute, the board shall submit a 
                report to the President setting forth its selection of 
                the most reasonable offer.

                Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 
                9A(h) of the Act, from the time a request to establish 
                a board is made until 60 days after the board makes its 
                report, no change, except by agreement, shall be made 
                by the parties in the conditions out of which the 
                dispute arose.

                Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of 
                the board are records of the Office of the President 
                and upon the board's termination shall be maintained in 
                the physical custody of the National Mediation Board.

                Sec. 5. Expiration. The board shall terminate upon 
                submission of the report provided for in section 2 of 
                this order.

                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,

                     November 15, 1996.
