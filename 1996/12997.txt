                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
                America, including section 1 of the International

                Development Organization is a public international 
                organization in which the United States participates 
                within the meaning of the International Organizations 
                Immunities Act, I hereby designate the Korean Peninsula 
                Energy Development Organization as a public 
                international organization entitled to enjoy the
