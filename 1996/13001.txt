                Executive Order 13001 of May 8, 1996

                
Establishing an Emergency Board To Investigate a 
                Dispute Between Certain Railroads Represented by the 
                National Railway Labor Conference and Their Employees 
                Represented by the Transportation Communications 
                International Union

                A dispute exists between certain railroads represented 
                by the National Railway Labor Conference and their 
                employees represented by the Transportation 
                Communications International Union. The railroads 
                involved in this dispute are designated on the attached 
                list, which is made a part of this order.

                This dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the 
                provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 
                U.S.C. 151 et seq.) (the ``Act'').

                In the judgment of the National Mediation Board, this 
                dispute threatens substantially to interrupt interstate 
                commerce to a degree that would deprive a section of 
                the country of essential transportation service.

                NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as 
                President by the Constitution and the laws of the 
                United States, including section 10 of the Act (45 
                U.S.C. 160), it is hereby ordered as follows:

                Section 1. Establishment of Emergency Board 
                (``Board''). There is established effective May 8, 
                1996, a Board of three members to be appointed by the 
                President to investigate the dispute. No member shall 
                be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any 
                organization of railroad employees or any railroad 
                carrier. The Board shall perform its functions subject 
                to the availability of funds.

                Sec. 2. Report. The Board shall report to the President 
                with respect to the dispute within 30 days of its 
                creation.

                Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 
                10 of the Act, from the date of the creation of the 
                Board and for 30 days after the Board has made its 
                report to the President, no change, except by agreement 
                of the parties shall be made by the railroads or the 
                employees in the conditions out of which the dispute 
                arose.

                Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of 
                the Board are records of the Office of the President 
                and upon the Board's termination shall be maintained in 
                the physical custody of the National Mediation Board.

                Sec. 5. Expiration. The Board shall terminate upon the 
                submission of the report provided for in sections 2 and 
                3 of this order.

                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,

                    May 8, 1996.
