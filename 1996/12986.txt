International Union for Conservation of Nature 
                and Natural Resources

                By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by 
                the Constitution and the laws of the United States, 
                including sections 1 and 14 of the International 
                Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288 et seq., as 
                amended by section 426 of the Foreign Relations 
                Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, Public 
                Law 103-236), I hereby extend to the International 
                Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources 
                the privileges and immunities that provide or pertain 
                to immunity from suit. To this effect, the following 
                sections of the International Organizations Immunities 
                Act shall not apply to the International Union for 
                Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources:

                    --Section 2(b), 22 U.S.C. 288a(b), that provides 
                international organizations and their property and 
                assets with the same immunity from suit and judicial 
                process as is enjoyed by foreign governments.
                    --Section 2(c), 22 U.S.C. 288a(c), that provides 
                that the property and assets of international 
                organizations shall be immune from search and 
                confiscation and that their archives shall be 
                inviolable.
                    --Section 7(b), 22 U.S.C. 288d(b), that provides 
                the representatives of foreign governments in or to 
                international organizations and the officers and 
                employees of such organizations with immunity from suit 
                and legal process relating to acts performed by them in 
                their official capacity and falling within their 
                functions.

                This designation is not intended to abridge in any 
                respect privileges, exemptions, or immunities that the 
                International Union for Conservation of Nature and 
                Natural Resources may have acquired or may acquire by 
                international agreements or by congressional action.

                    (Presidential Sig.)
