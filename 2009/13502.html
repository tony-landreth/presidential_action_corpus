        <h1 id="h-1">Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="6985">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act,  <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=40&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=101&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">40 U.S.C. 101</a> <em>et seq.</em>, and in order to promote the efficient administration and completion of Federal construction projects,  it is hereby ordered that:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="6985">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em>Policy.</em> (a)  Large-scale construction projects pose special challenges to efficient and timely procurement by the Federal Government.  Construction employers typically do not have a permanent workforce, which makes it difficult for them to predict labor costs when bidding on contracts and to ensure a steady supply of labor on contracts being performed.  Challenges also arise due to the fact that construction projects typically involve multiple employers at a single location.  A labor dispute involving one employer can delay the entire project. A lack of coordination among various employers, or uncertainty about the terms and conditions of employment of various groups of workers, can create frictions and disputes in the absence of  an agreed-upon resolution mechanism.  These problems threaten the efficient and timely completion of construction projects undertaken by Federal contractors.  On larger projects, which are generally more complex and of longer duration, these problems tend to be more pronounced.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="6985">(b)  The use of a project labor agreement may prevent these problems from developing by providing structure and stability    to large-scale construction projects, thereby promoting the efficient and expeditious completion of Federal construction contracts.  Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal Government to encourage executive agencies to consider    requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection    with large-scale construction projects in order to promote  economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.</p>
