        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13927">Executive Order 13927</a> of June 4, 2020
        <h1 id="h-1">Accelerating the Nation's Economic Recovery From the COVID-19 Emergency by Expediting Infrastructure Investments and Other Activities</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="35165">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby determine and authorize as follows: </p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="35165">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose</em>. The 2019 novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing outbreaks of the disease COVID-19, has significantly disrupted the lives of Americans. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared, pursuant to the National Emergencies Act, <a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1601?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq</em>., that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency that posed a threat to our national security (“the national emergency”). I also determined that same day that the COVID-19 outbreak constituted an emergency of nationwide scope, pursuant to section 501(b) of the Stafford Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/5191?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">42 U.S.C. 5191</a>(b)).</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="35165">Since I declared this national emergency, the American people have united behind a policy of mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The unavoidable result of the COVID-19 outbreak and these necessary mitigation measures has been a dramatic downturn in our economy. National unemployment claims have reached historic levels. In the days between the national emergency declaration and May 23, 2020, more than 41 million Americans filed for unemployment, and the unemployment rate reached 14.7 percent. In light of this and other developments, I have determined that, without intervention, the United States faces the likelihood of a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistent high unemployment. </p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="35165">From the beginning of my Administration, I have focused on reforming and streamlining an outdated regulatory system that has held back our economy with needless paperwork and costly delays. Antiquated regulations and bureaucratic practices have hindered American infrastructure investments, kept America's building trades workers from working, and prevented our citizens from developing and enjoying the benefits of world-class infrastructure. </p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="35165">The need for continued progress in this streamlining effort is all the more acute now, due to the ongoing economic crisis. Unnecessary regulatory delays will deny our citizens opportunities for jobs and economic security, keeping millions of Americans out of work and hindering our economic recovery from the national emergency.</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="35165">In tandem with this regulatory reform, I will continue to use existing legal authorities to respond to the full dimensions of the national emergency and its economic consequences. These authorities include statutes and regulations that allow for expedited government decision making in exigent circumstances. </p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="35165">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy</em>. Agencies, including executive departments, should take all appropriate steps to use their lawful emergency authorities and other authorities to respond to the national emergency and to facilitate the Nation's economic recovery. As set forth in this order, agencies should take all reasonable measures to speed infrastructure investments and to speed other <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="35166"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-35166" data-page="35166" data-text="Start Printed Page 35166" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 35166}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 35166</span></span></span>actions in addition to such investments that will strengthen the economy and return Americans to work, while providing appropriate protection for public health and safety, natural resources, and the environment, as required by law. For purposes of this order, the term “agencies” has the meaning given that term in section 3502(1), of title 44, United States Code, except for the agencies described in section 3502(5) of title 44.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. <em>National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Emergency Regulations and Emergency Procedures</em>.

Such flexibility is expressly authorized in CEQ's regulations, contained in title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, that implement the procedural provisions of NEPA (the “NEPA regulations”), which were first issued in 1978. These regulations provide that when emergency circumstances make it necessary to take actions with significant environmental impacts without observing the regulations, agencies may consult with CEQ to make alternative arrangements to take such actions. Using this authority, CEQ has appropriately approved alternative arrangements in a wide variety of pressing emergency situations. These emergencies have included not only natural disasters and threats to the national defense, but also threats to human and animal health, energy security, agriculture and farmers, and employment and economic prosperity. </p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="35167">(a) No later than 30 days of the date of this order, the heads of all agencies: </p>
