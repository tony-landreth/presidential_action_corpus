        <h1 id="h-1">Blocking Property of Certain Persons With Respect to the Conventional Arms Activities of Iran</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="60043">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (<a class="publ external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/115/public/44?link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 115-44</a>), the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1701?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1601?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq.</em>), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/8/1182?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1182</a>(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="60043">I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that:</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="60043">It remains the policy of the United States to counter Iran's malign influence in the Middle East, including transfers from Iran of destabilizing conventional weapons and acquisition of arms and related materiel by Iran. Transfers to and from Iran of arms or related materiel or military equipment represent a continuing threat to regional and international security—as evidenced by Iran's continued military support that fuels ongoing conflict in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen. Iran benefits from engaging in the conventional arms trade by strengthening its relationships with other outlier regimes, lessening its international isolation, and deriving revenue that it uses to support terror groups and fund malign activities. In light of these findings and in order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957</a> of March 15, 1995 (Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to the Development of Iranian Petroleum Resources), I hereby order:</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="60043">
          <strong>Section. 1</strong>. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-5" data-page="60043">(i) any person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to engage in any activity that materially contributes to the supply, sale, or transfer, directly or indirectly, to or from Iran, or for the use in or benefit of Iran, of arms or related materiel, including spare parts;</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-6" data-page="60043">(ii) any person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide to Iran any technical training, financial resources or services, advice, other services, or assistance related to the supply, sale, transfer, manufacture, maintenance, or use of arms and related materiel described in subsection (a)(i) of this section;</p>

        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-7" data-page="60043">(iii) any person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to have engaged, or attempted to engage, in any activity that materially contributes to, or poses a risk of materially contributing to, the proliferation of arms or related materiel or items intended for military end-uses or military end-users, including any efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer, or use such items, by the Government of Iran (including persons owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of the Government of Iran) or paramilitary organizations financially or militarily supported by the Government of Iran;<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="60044"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element document-markup bootstrap-popover" id="page-60044" data-page="60044" data-text="Start Printed Page 60044" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-toggle="popover" data-original-title="" data-placement="left" data-html="true" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 60044}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text cj-tooltip" data-tooltip="Click for more print page information">Start Printed Page 60044</span></span></span>

        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-8" data-page="60044">(iv) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-9" data-page="60044">(v) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="60044">(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="60044">(c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section do not apply to property and interests in property of the Government of Iran that were blocked pursuant to Executive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979 (Blocking Iranian Government Property), and thereafter made subject to the transfer directives set forth in Executive Order 12281 of January 19, 1981 (Direction to Transfer Certain Iranian Government Assets), and implementing regulations thereunder.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="60044">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="60044">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="60044">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="60044">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except where the Secretary of State determines that the person's entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person's entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. In exercising this responsibility, the Secretary of State shall consult the Secretary of Homeland Security on matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Such persons shall be treated in the same manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility for implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary of State has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="60044">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="60044">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="60044">
          <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1702?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957,</a> and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="60044">
          <strong>Sec. 6</strong>.

        <p id="p-21" data-page="60045">(b) the term “Government of Iran” includes the Government of Iran; any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Iran; and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran;</p>

          <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 8</strong>.

The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="60045">
          <strong>Sec. 9</strong>. This order shall not apply with respect to any person for conducting or facilitating a transaction for the provision (including any sale) of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices to Iran.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 11</strong>. The measures taken pursuant to this order are in response to actions of the Government of Iran occurring after the conclusion of the 1981 Algiers Accords, and are intended solely as a response to those later actions.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 12</strong>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
