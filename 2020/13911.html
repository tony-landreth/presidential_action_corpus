          <h1 id="h-1">Delegating Additional Authority Under the Defense Production Act With Respect to Health and Medical Resources To Respond to the Spread of COVID-19</h1>

          <p id="p-1" data-page="18403">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/4501?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 4501</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (the “Act”), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1601?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq.</em>), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="18403">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak), I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 poses to our Nation's healthcare systems. In recognizing the public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) can be characterized as a pandemic. I also noted that while the Federal Government, along with State and local governments, have taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and to treat those affected, the spread of COVID-19 within our Nation's communities threatens to strain our Nation's healthcare systems.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="18403">To deal with this threat, on March 18, 2020, I issued <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13909">Executive Order 13909</a> (Prioritizing and Allocating Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID-19), in which I delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the prioritization and allocation authority under section 101 of the Act with respect to health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19. And on March 23, 2020, I issued <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13910">Executive Order 13910</a> (Preventing Hoarding of Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID-19), in which I delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority under section 102 of the Act to combat hoarding and price gouging with respect to such resources.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="18403">To ensure that our healthcare systems are able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID-19, it is the policy of the United States to expand domestic production of health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19, including personal protective equipment and ventilators. Accordingly, I am delegating authority under title III of the Act to guarantee loans by private institutions, make loans, make provision for purchases and commitments to purchase, and take additional actions to create, maintain, protect, expand, and restore domestic industrial base capabilities to produce such resources. To enable greater cooperation among private businesses in expanding production of and distributing such resources, I am also delegating my authority under section 708(c) and (d) of the Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/4558?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 4558</a>(c), (d)) to provide for the making of voluntary agreements and plans of action by the private sector.</p>
