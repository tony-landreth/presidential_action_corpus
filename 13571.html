        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13571">Executive Order 13571</a> of April 27, 2011
        <h1 id="h-1">Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="24339">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve the quality of service to the public by the Federal Government, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="24339">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em>Policy.</em> The public deserves competent, efficient, and responsive service from the Federal Government. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) must continuously evaluate their performance in meeting this standard and work to improve it. To this end, Executive Order 12862 (Setting Customer Service Standards), issued on September 11, 1993, requires agencies that provide significant services directly to the public to identify and survey their customers, establish service standards and track performance against those standards, and benchmark customer service performance against the best in business. This effort to “put people first” was an important step. It was reinforced by a Presidential Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies issued on March 22, 1995 (Improving Customer Service), and a further Presidential Memorandum issued on March 3, 1998 (Conducting “Conversations with America” to Further Improve Customer Service).</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="24339">However, with advances in technology and service delivery systems in other sectors, the public's expectations of the Government have continued to rise. The Government must keep pace with and even exceed those expectations. Government must also address the need to improve its services, not only to individuals, but also to private and Governmental entities to which the agency directly provides significant services. Government managers must learn from what is working in the private sector and apply these best practices to deliver services better, faster, and at lower cost. Such best practices include increasingly popular lower-cost, self-service options accessed by the Internet or mobile phone and improved processes that deliver services faster and more responsively, reducing the overall need for customer inquiries and complaints. The Federal Government has a responsibility to streamline and make more efficient its service delivery to better serve the public.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="24339">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
          <em>Agency Customer Service Plans and Activities.</em> Within 180 days of the date of this order, each agency shall develop, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a Customer Service Plan (plan) to address how the agency will provide services in a manner that seeks to streamline service delivery and improve the experience of its customers. As used in this order, the term “customer” refers to any individual or to any entity, including a business, tribal, State or local government, or other agency, to which the agency directly provides significant services. The plan shall set forth the agency's approach, intended benefits, and an implementation timeline for the following actions:</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="24339">(a) establishing one major initiative (signature initiative) that will use technology to improve the customer experience;</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="24339">(b) establishing mechanisms to solicit customer feedback on Government services and using such feedback regularly to make service improvements;</p>

        <p id="p-7" data-page="24339">(c) setting clear customer service standards and expectations, including, where appropriate, performance goals for customer service required by the <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="24340"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-24340" data-page="24340" data-text="Start Printed Page 24340" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 24340}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 24340</span></span></span>GPRA (Government Performance and Results) Modernization Act of 2010 (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=111&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=352&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 111-352</a>);</p>
