          <strong>Section 1</strong>. (a) The following are prohibited:</p>
        (i) new investment in the Crimea region of Ukraine by a United States person, wherever located;

          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person (including any foreign branch) of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:</p>

        <p id="p-15" data-page="77358">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in subsection 2(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="77358">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 2 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13660">Executive Order 13660,</a> and expanded in Executive Orders 13661 and 13662, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 2 of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="77358">
          <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. The prohibitions in section 2 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>

        <p id="p-19" data-page="77358">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="77358">
          <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>

        <p id="p-22" data-page="77358">
          <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.</p>
        <p id="p-23" data-page="77358">
          <strong>Sec. 8</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
        <p id="p-24" data-page="77358">(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</p>
        <p id="p-25" data-page="77358">(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="77358">(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and</p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="77358">(d) the term “Crimea region of Ukraine” includes the land territory in that region as well as any maritime area over which sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction is claimed based on purported sovereignty over that land territory.</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="77358">
          <strong>Sec. 9</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13660">Executive Order 13660</a> and expanded in Executive Orders 13661 and 13662, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 2 of this order.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="77359"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-77359" data-page="77359" data-text="Start Printed Page 77359" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 77359}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 77359</span></span></span>
