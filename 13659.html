          <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13659">Executive Order 13659</a> of February 19, 2014
          <h1 id="h-1">Streamlining the Export/Import Process for America's Businesses</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="10657">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to reduce supply chain barriers to commerce while continuing to protect our national security, public health and safety, the environment, and natural resources, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="10657">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> The United States is the world's largest economy and the largest trading Nation. Trade is critical to the Nation's prosperity—fueling economic growth, supporting good jobs at home, raising living standards, and helping Americans provide for their families with affordable goods and services. It is the policy of the United States to promote commerce through the effective implementation of an ambitious 21st century trade agenda and vigorous enforcement of our Nation's laws relating to trade, security, public health and safety, the environment, and natural resources. In support of these goals, and to ensure that our Nation is well-positioned to compete in an open, fair, and growing world economy, the Federal Government must increase efforts to improve the technologies, policies, and other controls governing the movement of goods across our national borders.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="10657">In particular, we must increase efforts to complete the development of efficient and cost-effective trade processing infrastructure, such as the International Trade Data System (ITDS), to modernize and simplify the way that executive departments and agencies (agencies) interact with traders. We must also improve the broader trade environment through the development of innovative policies and operational processes that promote effective application of regulatory controls, collaborative arrangements with stakeholders, and a reduction of unnecessary procedural requirements that add costs to both agencies and industry and undermine our Nation's economic competitiveness. By demonstrating our commitment to utilizing technology, coordinating government processes, fulfilling international obligations, and embracing innovative approaches to promote new opportunities for trade facilitation in the 21st century, we can lead by example and partner with other countries willing to adopt similar programs. This will encourage compliance with applicable laws and, more broadly, result in a more prosperous, safe, secure, and sustainable trading environment for all.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="10657">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy Coordination.</em> Policy coordination, guidance, dispute resolution, and periodic reviews for the functions and programs set forth in this order shall be provided through the interagency process established in Presidential Policy Directive-1 of February 13, 2009 (Organization of the National Security Council System), or any successor.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="10657">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. <em>International Trade Data System.</em> The ITDS, as described in section 405 of the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 (the “SAFE Port Act”) (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=109&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=347&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 109-347</a>), is an electronic information exchange capability, or “single window,” through which businesses will transmit data required by participating agencies for the importation or exportation of cargo. To enhance Federal coordination associated with the development of the ITDS and to provide necessary transparency to businesses, agencies, and other potential users:<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="10658"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-10658" data-page="10658" data-text="Start Printed Page 10658" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 10658}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 10658</span></span></span>

          <p id="p-6" data-page="10658">(a) by December 31, 2016, participating agencies shall have capabilities, agreements, and other requirements in place to utilize the ITDS and supporting systems, such as the Automated Commercial Environment, as the primary means of receiving from users the standard set of data and other relevant documentation (exclusive of applications for permits, licenses, or certifications) required for the release of imported cargo and clearance of cargo for export;</p>

          (i) transmit a harmonized set of import and export data elements, to be collected, stored, and shared, via a secure single window, to fulfill U.S. Government requirements for the release and clearance of goods; and
          (ii) transition from paper-based requirements and procedures to faster and more cost-effective electronic submissions to, and communications with, agencies;
          <p id="p-10" data-page="10658">(c) the Board shall, in consultation with ITDS participating agencies, define the standard set of data elements to be collected, stored, and shared in the ITDS; and continue to periodically review those data elements in order to update the standard set of data elements, as necessary;</p>
