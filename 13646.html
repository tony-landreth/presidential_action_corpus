          <h1 id="h-1">Establishing the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="39159">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="39159">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> To contribute to the Nation's future financial stability and increase upward economic mobility, it is the policy of the Federal Government to promote financial capability among young Americans and encourage building the financial capability of young people at an early stage in schools, families, communities, and the workplace. By starting early, young people can begin to learn the difference between wants and needs, the importance and power of saving, and the positive and productive role money can play in their lives. Having a basic understanding of money management from an early age will make our young people better equipped to tackle more complex financial decisions in their transition to adulthood, when critical decisions about financing higher education and saving for retirement can have lasting consequences for financial security. Strengthening the financial capability of our young people is an investment in our Nation's economic prosperity.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="39159">Financial capability is the capacity, based on knowledge, skills, and access, to manage financial resources prudently and effectively. Efforts to improve financial capability, which should be based on evidence of effectiveness, empower individuals to make informed choices, plan and set goals, avoid pitfalls, know where to seek help, and take other actions to better their present and long-term financial well-being.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="39159">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Establishment of the Council.</em> There is established within the Department of the Treasury the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans (Council).</p>
