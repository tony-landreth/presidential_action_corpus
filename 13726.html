To address this threat, and in view of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2174 of August 27, 2014, and 2213 of March 27, 2015, I hereby order:</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="23559">

        (ii) to be planning, directing, or committing, or to have planned, directed, or committed, attacks against any Libyan state facility or installation (including oil facilities), against any air, land, or sea port in Libya, or against any foreign mission in Libya;

        (iii) to be involved in, or to have been involved in, the targeting of civilians through the commission of acts of violence, abduction, forced displacement, or attacks on schools, hospitals, religious sites, or locations <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="23560"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-23560" data-page="23560" data-text="Start Printed Page 23560" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 23560}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 23560</span></span></span>where civilians are seeking refuge, or through conduct that would constitute a serious abuse or violation of human rights or a violation of international humanitarian law;
        (iv) to be involved in, or to have been involved in, the illicit exploitation of crude oil or any other natural resources in Libya, including the illicit production, refining, brokering, sale, purchase, or export of Libyan oil;

        <p id="p-16" data-page="23560">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). Further, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2174 shall be treated as a Resolution listed in Annex A of Proclamation 8693.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="23560">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13566">Executive Order 13566</a> and expanded in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="23560">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="23560">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="23560">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="23560">
          <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="23560">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>

        <p id="p-25" data-page="23560">(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="23561"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-23561" data-page="23561" data-text="Start Printed Page 23561" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 23561}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 23561</span></span></span>
        </p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="23561">(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.</p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="23561">(d) the term “Government of National Accord or a successor government” means:</p>
        (i) a Government of National Accord formed pursuant to the terms of the Libyan Political Agreement signed in Skhirat, Morocco, on December 17, 2015, or any amendments thereto;
        (ii) a governmental authority formed under the Libyan Constitution pursuant to the terms of the Libyan Political Agreement signed in Skhirat, Morocco, on December 17, 2015, or any amendments thereto;
        (iii) any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the foregoing, and any partnership, association, corporation, or other organization owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by, or acting for or on behalf of, the foregoing; or
        (iv) any other person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be included within paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
        <p id="p-32" data-page="23561">
          <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13566">Executive Order 13566</a> and expanded in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-33" data-page="23561">
          <strong>Sec. 8</strong>. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and the UNPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
