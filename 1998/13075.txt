                By the authority vested in me as President by the

                Government.

                    (b) The President shall designate a Chairperson and

                advice and recommendations based on its review of 
                Department of Defense investigations into possible 
                detections of, and exposures to, chemical or biological 
                weapons agents and environmental and other factors that 
                may have contributed to Gulf War illnesses.

                any legal liability of the Federal Government for any 
                claims or potential claims against the Federal 
                Government.
                    (e) The Special Oversight Board shall submit an 
                interim report within 9 months of its first meeting and 
                a final report within 18 months of its first meeting, 
                unless otherwise directed by the President.

                Sec. 3. Administration. (a) The heads of executive 
                departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted 
                by law, provide the Special Oversight Board with such 
                information as it may require for purposes of carrying 
                out its functions.

                    (b) Special Oversight Board members may be allowed 
                travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of 
                subsistence, to the extent permitted by law for persons 
                serving intermittently in the Government service (5 
                U.S.C. 5701-5707). The administrative staff for the 
                Special Oversight Board shall be compensated in

                the availability of appropriations, the Department of 
                Defense shall provide the Special Oversight Board with 
                such funds as may be necessary for the performance of 
                its functions.

                Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Notwithstanding the 
                provisions of any other Executive order, the functions 
                of the President under the Federal Advisory Committee

                internal management of the executive branch and it is 
                not intended, and shall not be construed, to create any
