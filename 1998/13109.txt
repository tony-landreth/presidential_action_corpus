                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
                America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

                Section 1. All executive departments and agencies of 
                the Federal Government shall be closed and their 
                employees excused from duty for the last half of the 
                scheduled workday on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1998, 
                except as provided in section 2 below.

                Sec. 2. The heads of executive departments and agencies 
                may determine that certain offices and installations of 
                their organizations, or parts thereof, must remain open 
                and that certain employees must remain on duty for the 
                full scheduled workday on December 24, 1998, for 
                reasons of national security or defense or for other 
                essential public reasons.

                Sec. 3. Thursday, December 24, 1998, shall be 
                considered as falling within the scope of Executive 
                Order 11582 and of 5 U.S.C. 5546 and 6103(b) and other 
                similar statutes insofar as they relate to the pay and 
                leave of employees of the United States.

                Sec. 4. This order shall apply to executive departments 
                and agencies of the Federal Government only and is not 
                intended to direct or otherwise implicate departments 
                or agencies of State or local governments.

                    (Presidential Sig.)
