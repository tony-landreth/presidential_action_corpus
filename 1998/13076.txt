Ordering the Selected Reserve of the Armed Forces 
                to Active Duty

                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
                America, including sections 121 and 12304 of title 10, 
                United States Code, I hereby determine that it is 
                necessary to augment the active armed forces of the 
                United States for the effective conduct of operations 
                in and around Southwest Asia. Further, under the stated 
                authority, I hereby authorize the Secretary of Defense, 
                and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the 
                Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in 
                the Department of the Navy, to order to active duty any 
                units, and any individual members not assigned to a 
                unit organized to serve as a unit, of the Selected 
                Reserve.

                This order is intended only to improve the internal 
                management of the executive branch and is not intended 
                to create any right or benefit, substantive or 
                procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the 
                United States, its agencies, its officers, or any 
                person.

                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,

                     February 24, 1998.
