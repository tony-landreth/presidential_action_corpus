                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
                America, and in order to create the Information 
                Coordination Center to assist the Chair of the 
                President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion in 
                addressing year 2000 conversion problems both 
                domestically and internationally, it is hereby ordered 
                that Executive Order 13073 is amended as follows:

                included under section 2(c) of this order, there shall 
                be established the Information Coordination Center 
                (ICC) in the General Services Administration.

                    (b) At the direction of the Chair, the ICC will 
                assist in making preparations for information sharing 
                and coordination within the Federal Government and key 
                components of the public and private sectors, 
                coordinating agency assessments of Y2K emergencies that 
                could have an adverse affect on U.S. interests at home 
                and abroad, and, if necessary, assisting Federal 
                agencies and the Chair in reconstitution processes 
                where appropriate.
                    (c) The ICC will:
                    (1) consist of officials from executive agencies, 
                designated by agency heads under subsection 3(a)(2) of 
                this order, who have expertise in important management 
                and technical areas, computer hardware, software or 
                security systems, reconstitution and recovery, and of 
                additional personnel hired directly or by contract, as 
                required, to carry out the duties described under 
                section 5 of this order;
                    (2) work with the Council and the Office of 
                Management and Budget to assure that Federal efforts to 
                restore critical systems are coordinated with efforts 
                managed by Federal agencies acting under existing 
                emergency response authorities.''
                    (d) The Chair of the President's Council on Year
