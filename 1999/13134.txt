                Executive Order 13134 of August 12, 1999

                
Developing and Promoting Biobased Products and 
                Bioenergy

                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
                America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 
                as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), and in order to stimulate 
                the creation and early adoption of technologies needed 
                to make biobased products and bioenergy cost-
                competitive in large national and international 
                markets, it is hereby ordered as follows:

                Section 1. Policy. Current biobased product and 
                bioenergy technology has the potential to make 
                renewable farm and forestry resources major sources of 
                affordable electricity, fuel, chemicals, 
                pharmaceuticals, and other materials. Technical 
                advances in these areas can create an expanding array 
                of exciting new business and employment opportunities 
                for farmers, foresters, ranchers, and other businesses 
                in rural America. These technologies can create new 
                markets for farm and forest waste products, new 
                economic opportunities for underused land, and new 
                value-added business opportunities. They also have the 
                potential to reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign 
                oil, improve air quality, water quality, and flood 
                control, decrease erosion, and help minimize net 
                production of greenhouse gases. It is the policy of 
                this Administration, therefore, to develop a 
                comprehensive national strategy, including research, 
                development, and private sector incentives, to 
                stimulate the creation and early adoption of 
                technologies needed to make biobased products and 
                bioenergy cost-competitive in large national and 
                international markets.

                Sec. 2. Establishment of the Interagency Council on 
                Biobased Products and Bioenergy. (a) There is 
                established the Interagency Council on Biobased 
                Products and Bioenergy (the ``Council''). The Council 
                shall be composed of the Secretaries of Agriculture, 
                Commerce, Energy, and the Interior, the Administrator 
                of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of 
                the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to 
                the President for Science and Technology, the Director 
                of the National Science Foundation, the Federal 
                Environmental Executive, and the heads of other 
                relevant agencies as may be determined by the Co-Chairs 
                of the Council. Members may serve on the Council 
                through designees. Designees shall be senior officials 
                who report directly to the agency head (Assistant 
                Secretary or equivalent).

                    (b) The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary 
                of Energy shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Council.
                    (c) The Council shall prepare annually a strategic 
                plan for the President outlining overall national goals 
                in the development and use of biobased products and 
                bioenergy in an environmentally sound manner and how 
                these goals can best be achieved through Federal 
                programs and integrated planning. The goals shall 
                include promoting national economic growth with 
                specific attention to rural economic interests, energy 
                security, and environmental sustainability and 
                protection. These strategic plans shall be compatible 
                with the national goal of producing safe and affordable 
                supplies of food, feed, and fiber in a way that is 
                sustainable and protects the environment, and shall 
                include measurable objectives. Specifically, these 
                strategic plans shall cover the following areas:
                    L(1) biobased products, including commercial and 
                industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, products with 
                large carbon sequestering capacity, and other
