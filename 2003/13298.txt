          I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the situation that gave rise to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993, with respect to the actions and policies of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and that led to the steps taken in that order and in Executive Order 13069 of December 12, 1997, and Executive Order 13098 of August 18, 1998, has been significantly altered by the recent and continuing steps toward peace taken by the Government of Angola and UNITA. Accordingly, I hereby terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12865, revoke Executive Orders 12865, 13069, and 13098, and order:
