        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13647">Executive Order 13647</a> of June 26, 2013
        <h1 id="h-1">Establishing the White House Council on Native American Affairs</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="39539">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote and sustain prosperous and resilient Native American tribal governments, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="39539">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> The United States recognizes a government-to-government relationship, as well as a unique legal and political relationship, with federally recognized tribes. This relationship is set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, administrative rules and regulations, and judicial decisions. Honoring these relationships and respecting the sovereignty of tribal nations is critical to advancing tribal self-determination and prosperity.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="39539">As we work together to forge a brighter future for all Americans, we cannot ignore a history of mistreatment and destructive policies that have hurt tribal communities. The United States seeks to continue restoring and healing relations with Native Americans and to strengthen its partnership with tribal governments, for our more recent history demonstrates that tribal self-determination—the ability of tribal governments to determine how to build and sustain their own communities—is necessary for successful and prospering communities. We further recognize that restoring tribal lands through appropriate means helps foster tribal self-determination.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="39539">This order establishes a national policy to ensure that the Federal Government engages in a true and lasting government-to-government relationship with federally recognized tribes in a more coordinated and effective manner, including by better carrying out its trust responsibilities. This policy is established as a means of promoting and sustaining prosperous and resilient tribal communities. Greater engagement and meaningful consultation with tribes is of paramount importance in developing any policies affecting tribal nations.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="39539">To honor treaties and recognize tribes' inherent sovereignty and right to self-government under U.S. law, it is the policy of the United States to promote the development of prosperous and resilient tribal communities, including by:</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="39539">(a) promoting sustainable economic development, particularly energy, transportation, housing, other infrastructure, entrepreneurial, and workforce development to drive future economic growth and security;</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="39539">(b) supporting greater access to, and control over, nutrition and healthcare, including special efforts to confront historic health disparities and chronic diseases;</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="39539">(c) supporting efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of tribal justice systems and protect tribal communities;</p>

        <p id="p-9" data-page="39539">(d) expanding and improving lifelong educational opportunities for American Indians and Alaska Natives, while respecting demands for greater tribal control over tribal education, consistent with <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13592">Executive Order 13592</a> of December 2, 2011 (Improving American Indian and Alaska Native Educational Opportunities and Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities); and<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="39540"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-39540" data-page="39540" data-text="Start Printed Page 39540" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 39540}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 39540</span></span></span>
