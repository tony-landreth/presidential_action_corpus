        <p id="p-1" data-page="63533">Disputes exist between certain railroads represented by the National Carriers' Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference and their employees represented by certain labor organizations.  The railroads and labor organizations involved in these disputes are designated on the attached list, which is made part of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="63533">The disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=45&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=151&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">45 U.S.C. 151</a>-188 (RLA).</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="63533">I have been notified by the National Mediation Board that in its judgment these disputes threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree that would deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service.</p>
