          <h1 id="h-1">Interpretation of the Geneva Conventions Common Article 3 as Applied to a Program of Detention and Interrogation Operated by the Central Intelligence Agency</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="40707">By the authority vested in me as President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of Military Force (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=107&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=40&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 107-40</a>), the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=109&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=366&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 109-366</a>), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em>General Determinations</em>. (a) The United States is engaged in an armed conflict with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. Members of al Qaeda were responsible for the attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, and for many other terrorist attacks, including against the United States, its personnel, and its allies throughout the world. These forces continue to fight the United States and its allies in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, and they continue to plan additional acts of terror throughout the world. On February 7, 2002, I determined for the United States that members of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces are unlawful enemy combatants who are not entitled to the protections that the Third Geneva Convention provides to prisoners of war. I hereby reaffirm that determination.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="40707">(b) The Military Commissions Act defines certain prohibitions of Common Article 3 for United States law, and it reaffirms and reinforces the authority of the President to interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions.</p>

          (2) could assist in locating the senior leadership of al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces;
