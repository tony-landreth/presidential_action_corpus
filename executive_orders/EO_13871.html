          <h1 id="h-1">Imposing Sanctions With Respect to the Iron, Steel, Aluminum, and Copper Sectors of Iran</h1>

          <p id="p-1" data-page="20761">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1701?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1601?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq.</em>), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/8/1182?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1182</a>(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="20761">It remains the policy of the United States to deny Iran all paths to both a nuclear weapon and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and to counter the totality of Iran's malign influence in the Middle East. It is also the policy of the United States to deny the Iranian government revenue, including revenue derived from the export of products from Iran's iron, steel, aluminum, and copper sectors, that may be used to provide funding and support for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorist groups and networks, campaigns of regional aggression, and military expansion.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="20761">In light of these findings and in order to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957</a> of March 15, 1995, and to supplement the authorities provided in the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 (subtitle D of title XII of <a class="publ external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/112/public/239?link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 112-239</a>), I hereby order:</p>

          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-12" data-page="20762">(i) for the sale, supply, or transfer to Iran of significant goods or services used in connection with the iron, steel, aluminum, or copper sectors of Iran;</p>

          <p id="p-16" data-page="20762">(c) The prohibitions in subsection (b) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-17" data-page="20762">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/1702?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957,</a> and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by this section.</p>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="20762">

            <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in subsection 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is therefore hereby suspended. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>

          </p>
          <p id="p-26" data-page="20763">(a) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>

It includes, but is not limited to, depository institutions, banks, savings banks, money service businesses, trust companies, securities brokers and dealers, commodity futures and options brokers and dealers, forward contract and foreign exchange merchants, securities and commodities exchanges, clearing corporations, investment companies, employee benefit plans, dealers in precious metals, stones, or jewels, and holding companies, affiliates, or subsidiaries of any of the foregoing. The term does not include the international financial institutions identified in <a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/22/262?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">22 U.S.C. 262</a>r(c)(2), the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the North American Development Bank, or any other international financial institution so notified by the Secretary of the Treasury;</p>
          <p id="p-28" data-page="20763">(c) the term &ldquo;Government of Iran&rdquo; includes the Government of Iran, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Iran, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran;</p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="20763">(d) the term &ldquo;Iran&rdquo; means the Government of Iran and the territory of Iran and any other territory or marine area, including the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, over which the Government of Iran claims sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, provided that the Government of Iran exercises partial or total de facto control over the area or derives a benefit from economic activity in the area pursuant to international arrangements;</p>

          <p id="p-33" data-page="20763">
            <strong>Sec. 9</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
