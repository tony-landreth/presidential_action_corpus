        <p id="p-2" data-page="49469">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em> Policy.</em> The use of drugs in sports has reached a level that endangers not just the legitimacy of athletic competition but also the lives and health of athletes&mdash;from the elite ranks to youth leagues. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse issued in 1999 found that in just 1 year's time the rate of steroid use among young people rose roughly 50 percent among both sexes and across all age groups. It is the policy of my Administration to take the steps needed to help eliminate illicit or otherwise banned drug use and doping in sports at the State, national, and international level.</p>
