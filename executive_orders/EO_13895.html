        <h1 id="h-1">President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="57309">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish an advisory council on science and technology, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="57309">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> In every age of our Nation's history, American ingenuity has driven technological progress and the promise of the American Dream. Scientific advancement has improved the lives of our citizens, created jobs and better futures for American workers, and kept the American people safe at home and abroad. American thinkers, inventors, and entrepreneurs, empowered by free-market capitalism and driven by bold ideas, have created an ecosystem of innovation that is the envy of the world, making our Nation prosperous and strong.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="57309">Since World War II, our Nation's greatest scientists and engineers have advised the Federal Government, guiding the United States through the nuclear age, the mission to the moon, and the transformations of the digital revolution. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum information science are now on the horizon, and how we address their development will determine whether they give rise to new American industries or challenge American values. With American leadership facing fierce global competition, today more than ever our Nation is in need of new approaches for unleashing the creativity of our research enterprise and empowering private sector innovation to ensure American technological dominance.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="57309">Through collaborative partnerships across the American science and technology enterprise, which includes an unmatched constellation of public and private educational institutions, research laboratories, corporations, and foundations, the United States can usher extraordinary new technologies into homes, hospitals, and highways across the world. These technologies would have American values at their core. By strengthening the ties that connect government, industry, and academia, my Administration will champion a new era of American research and innovation, which will give rise to new discoveries that create the industries of the future.</p>
