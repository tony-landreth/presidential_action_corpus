        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13270">Executive Order 13270</a> of July 3, 2002
        <h1 id="h-1">Tribal Colleges and Universities</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="45288">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="45288">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em> Policy.</em> There is a unique relationship between the United States and Indian tribes, and a special relationship between the United States and Alaska Native entities. It is the policy of the Federal Government that this Nation's commitment to educational excellence and opportunity must extend as well to the tribal colleges and universities (tribal colleges) that serve Indian tribes and Alaska Native entities. The President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and Universities (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) and the White House Initiative on Tribal Colleges and Universities (WHITCU) established by this order shall ensure that this national policy regarding tribal colleges is carried out with direct accountability at the highest levels of the Federal Government.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="45288">Tribal colleges are both integral and essential to their communities. Often they are the only postsecondary institutions within some of our Nation's poorest rural areas. They fulfill a vital role: in maintaining and preserving irreplaceable languages and cultural traditions; in offering a high-quality college education to younger students; and in providing job training and other career-building programs to adults and senior citizens. Tribal colleges provide crucial services in communities that continue to suffer high rates of unemployment and the resulting social and economic distress.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="45288">The Federal Government's commitment to tribal colleges is reaffirmed and the private sector can and should contribute to the colleges' educational and cultural missions.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="45288">Finally, postsecondary institutions can play a vital role in promoting excellence in early childhood, elementary, and secondary education. The Federal Government will therefore work to implement the innovations and reforms of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=107&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=110&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 107-110</a>) in partnership with tribal colleges and their American Indian and Alaska Native communities.</p>
