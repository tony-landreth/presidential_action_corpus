        <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishing an Emergency Board to Investigate Disputes Between Certain Railroads Represented by the National Carriers' Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference and Their Employees Represented by Certain Labor Organizations</HD>
        <FP>Disputes exist between certain railroads represented by the National Carriers' Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference and their employees represented by certain labor organizations.  The railroads and labor organizations involved in these disputes are designated on the attached list, which is made part of this order.</FP>
        <FP>The disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151-188 (RLA).</FP>
        <FP>I have been notified by the National Mediation Board that in its judgment these disputes threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree that would deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service.</FP>
        <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 10 of the RLA (45 U.S.C. 160), it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>

No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier.  The Board shall perform its functions subject to the availability of funds.</FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E>
          <E T="03">Report. </E>The Board shall report to the President with respect to the disputes within 30 days of its creation.</FP>

        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 4.</E>
          <E T="03">Records Maintenance. </E>The records and files of the Board are records of the Office of the President and upon the Board's termination shall be maintained in the physical custody of the National Mediation Board.</FP>
