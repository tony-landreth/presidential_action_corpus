        <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13611 of May 16, 2012</EXECORDR>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">Blocking Property of Persons Threatening the Peace, Security, or Stability of Yemen </HD>

        <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq.) </E>(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.) </E>(NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, </FP>
        <FP>I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Yemen and others threaten Yemen's peace, security, and stability, including by obstructing the implementation of the agreement of November 23, 2011, between the Government of Yemen and those in opposition to it, which provides for a peaceful transition of power that meets the legitimate demands and aspirations of the Yemeni people for change, and by obstructing the political process in Yemen. I further find that these actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I hereby order: </FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Section 1.</E> All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, including any foreign branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:  any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to: </FP>
        <P>(a) have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen, such as acts that obstruct the implementation of the agreement of November 23, 2011, between the Government of Yemen and those in opposition to it, which provides for a peaceful transition of power in Yemen, or that obstruct the political process in Yemen; </P>
        <P>(b) be a political or military leader of an entity that has engaged in the acts described in subsection (a) of this section; </P>
        <P>(c) have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, the acts described in subsection (a) of this section or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or</P>
        <P>(d) be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order. </P>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E> I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. </FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 3.</E> The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not limited to: <PRTPAGE P="29534"/>
        </FP>
        <P>(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and </P>
        <P>(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. </P>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 4.</E> The prohibitions in section 1 of this order apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order. </FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 5.</E> Nothing in section 1 of this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof. </FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 6.</E> (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. </FP>
        <P>(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. </P>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 7.</E> For the purposes of this order: </FP>
        <P>(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity; </P>
        <P>(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and </P>
        <P>(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. </P>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 8.</E> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order. </FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 9.</E> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order. </FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 10.</E> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). </FP>
        
        <PRTPAGE P="29535"/>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 11.</E> This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. </FP>
