        <h1 id="h-1">Implementing the Clean Diamond Trade Act</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="45151">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Clean Diamond Trade Act (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=108&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=19&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 108-19</a>) (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq</em>.), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq</em>.), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=22&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=287&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">22 U.S.C. 287</a>c), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of the national emergency described and declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13194">Executive Order 13194</a> of January 18, 2001, and expanded in scope in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13213">Executive Order 13213</a> of May 22, 2001,</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="45151">I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, note that, in response to the role played by the illicit trade in diamonds in fueling conflict and human rights violations in Sierra Leone, the President declared a national emergency in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13194">Executive Order 13194</a> and imposed restrictions on the importation of rough diamonds into the United States from Sierra Leone. I expanded the scope of that emergency in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13213">Executive Order 13213</a> and prohibited absolutely the importation of rough diamonds from Liberia. I further note that representatives of the United States and numerous other countries announced in the Interlaken Declaration of November 5, 2002, the launch of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) for rough diamonds, under which Participants prohibit the importation of rough diamonds from, or the exportation of rough diamonds to, a non-Participant and require that shipments of rough diamonds from or to a Participant be controlled through the KPCS. The Clean Diamond Trade Act authorizes the President to take steps to implement the KPCS. Therefore, in order to implement the Act, to harmonize Executive Orders 13194 and 13213 with the Act, to address further threats to international peace and security posed by the trade in conflict diamonds, and to avoid undermining the legitimate diamond trade, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
