        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13581">Executive Order 13581</a> of July 24, 2011
        <h1 id="h-1">Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="44757">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq</em>.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq</em>.) (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, </p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="44757">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations, such as those listed in the Annex to this order, have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Such organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets. These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons. I therefore determine that significant transnational criminal organizations constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="44757">Accordingly, I hereby order:</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="44757">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong> (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:</p>
        (i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order and 
        (ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State:
        <p id="p-7" data-page="44757">(A) to be a foreign person that constitutes a significant transnational criminal organization;</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="44757">(B) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or </p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="44757">(C) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="44757">(b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by subsection (a) of this section.</p>

        <p id="p-11" data-page="44757">(c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section include, but are not limited to:<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="44758"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-44758" data-page="44758" data-text="Start Printed Page 44758" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 44758}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 44758</span></span></span>
        </p>
        (i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and
        (ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
        <p id="p-14" data-page="44758">(d) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="44758">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="44758">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="44758">
          <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> For the purposes of this order:</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="44758">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="44758">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="44758">(c) the term &ldquo;United States person&rdquo; means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;</p>
        <p id="p-21" data-page="44758">(d) the term &ldquo;foreign person&rdquo; means any citizen or national of a foreign state, or any entity organized under the laws of a foreign state or existing in a foreign state, including any such individual or entity who is also a United States person; and</p>
        <p id="p-22" data-page="44758">(e) the term &ldquo;significant transnational criminal organization&rdquo; means a group of persons, such as those listed in the Annex to this order, that includes one or more foreign persons; that engages in an ongoing pattern of serious criminal activity involving the jurisdictions of at least two foreign states; and that threatens the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.</p>
        <p id="p-23" data-page="44758">
          <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-24" data-page="44758">
          <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-25" data-page="44758">
          <strong>Sec. 6.</strong> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1641&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1641</a>(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1703&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1703</a>(c)).</p>

          <strong>Sec. 8.</strong> This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
