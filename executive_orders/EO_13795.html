        <h1 id="h-1">Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="20815">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=43&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1331&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">43 U.S.C. 1331</a> <em>et seq.,</em> and in order to maintain global leadership in energy innovation, exploration, and production, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="20815">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Findings.</em> America must put the energy needs of American families and businesses first and continue implementing a plan that ensures energy security and economic vitality for decades to come. The energy and minerals produced from lands and waters under Federal management are important to a vibrant economy and to our national security. Increased domestic energy production on Federal lands and waters strengthens the Nation's security and reduces reliance on imported energy. Moreover, low energy prices, driven by an increased American energy supply, will benefit American families and help reinvigorate American manufacturing and job growth. Finally, because the Department of Defense is one of the largest consumers of energy in the United States, domestic energy production also improves our Nation's military readiness.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="20815">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It shall be the policy of the United States to encourage energy exploration and production, including on the Outer Continental Shelf, in order to maintain the Nation's position as a global energy leader and foster energy security and resilience for the benefit of the American people, while ensuring that any such activity is safe and environmentally responsible.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="20815">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. <em>Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy.</em> To carry out the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, the Secretary of the Interior shall:</p>

        <p id="p-6" data-page="20815">(b) ensure that any revisions made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section do not hinder or affect ongoing lease sales currently scheduled as part of the 2017-2022 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed Final Program, as published on November 18, 2016; and</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="20815">(c) develop and implement, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce and to the maximum extent permitted by law, a streamlined permitting approach for privately funded seismic data research and collection aimed at expeditiously determining the offshore energy resource potential of the United States within the Planning Areas.</p>
