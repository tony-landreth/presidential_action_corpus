          <h1 id="h-1">Establishing Discipline and Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for Infrastructure Projects</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="40463">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure that the Federal environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects is coordinated, predictable, and transparent, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="40463">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> America needs increased infrastructure investment to strengthen our economy, enhance our competitiveness in world trade, create jobs and increase wages for our workers, and reduce the costs of goods and services for our families. The poor condition of America's infrastructure has been estimated to cost a typical American household thousands of dollars each year. Inefficiencies in current infrastructure project decisions, including management of environmental reviews and permit decisions or authorizations, have delayed infrastructure investments, increased project costs, and blocked the American people from enjoying improved infrastructure that would benefit our economy, society, and environment. More efficient and effective Federal infrastructure decisions can transform our economy, so the Federal Government, as a whole, must change the way it processes environmental reviews and authorization decisions.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="40463">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of the Federal Government to:</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="40463">(a) safeguard our communities and maintain a healthy environment;</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="40463">(b) ensure that Federal authorities make informed decisions concerning the environmental impacts of infrastructure projects;</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="40463">(c) develop infrastructure in an environmentally sensitive manner;</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="40463">(d) provide transparency and accountability to the public regarding environmental review and authorization decisions;</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="40463">(e) be good stewards of public funds, including those used to develop infrastructure projects, and avoid duplicative and wasteful processes;</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="40463">(f) conduct environmental reviews and authorization processes in a coordinated, consistent, predictable, and timely manner in order to give public and private investors the confidence necessary to make funding decisions for new infrastructure projects;</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="40463">(g) speak with a coordinated voice when conducting environmental reviews and making authorization decisions; and</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="40463">(h) make timely decisions with the goal of completing all Federal environmental reviews and authorization decisions for major infrastructure projects within 2 years.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. <em>Process Enhancements.</em> In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, Federal agencies shall follow a more unified environmental review and authorization process.</p>
          <p id="p-40" data-page="40466">(a) <em>Processing of Major Infrastructure Projects.</em> In processing environmental reviews and authorizations for major infrastructure projects, Federal agencies shall:</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-41" data-page="40466">(i) use &ldquo;One Federal Decision&rdquo; described in subsection (b) of this section;</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-42" data-page="40466">(ii) develop and follow a permitting timetable, which shall be reviewed and updated at least quarterly by the lead Federal agency in consultation with Federal cooperating and participating agencies; and</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-43" data-page="40466">(iii) follow an effective process that automatically elevates instances where a permitting timetable milestone is missed or extended, or is anticipated to be missed or extended, to appropriate senior agency officials of the lead Federal agency and the cooperating and participating Federal agency or agencies to which the milestone applies.</p>
          <p id="p-44" data-page="40466">(b) <em>One Federal Decision.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-45" data-page="40466">(i) Each major infrastructure project shall have a lead Federal agency, which shall be responsible for navigating the project through the Federal environmental review and authorization process, including the identification of a primary Federal point of contact at each Federal agency. All Federal cooperating and participating agencies shall identify points of contact for each project, cooperate with the lead Federal agency point of contact, and respond to all reasonable requests for information from the lead Federal agency in a timely manner.</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-46" data-page="40466">(ii) With respect to the applicability of NEPA to a major infrastructure project, the Federal lead, cooperating, and participating agencies for each major infrastructure project shall all record any individual agency decision in one Record of Decision (ROD), which shall be coordinated by the lead Federal agency unless the project sponsor requests that agencies issue separate NEPA documents, the NEPA obligations of a cooperating or participating agency have already been satisfied, or the lead Federal agency determines that a single ROD would not best promote completion of the project's environmental review and authorization process. The Federal lead, cooperating, and participating agencies shall all agree to a permitting timetable that includes the completion dates for the ROD and the federally required authorizations for the project.</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-47" data-page="40466">(iii) All Federal authorization decisions for the construction of a major infrastructure project shall be completed within 90 days of the issuance of a ROD by the lead Federal agency, provided that the final EIS includes an adequate level of detail to inform agency decisions pursuant to their specific statutory authority and requirements. The lead Federal agency may extend the 90-day deadline if the lead Federal agency determines that Federal law prohibits the agency from issuing its approval or permit within the 90-day period, the project sponsor requests that the permit or approval follow a different timeline, or the lead Federal agency determines that an extension would better promote completion of the project's environmental review and authorization process.</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-48" data-page="40466">(iv) The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and OMB shall develop the framework for implementing One Federal Decision, in consultation with the FPISC.</p>

          <p id="p-50" data-page="40467">(B) The framework shall also include guidance on the development of permitting timetables by the lead Federal agencies, in collaboration with Federal cooperating and participating agencies. Permitting timetables shall identify estimated intermediate and final completion dates for all environmental reviews and authorizations that are reasonably anticipated as being needed for a project, including the process for granting extensions of any established dates. The guidance shall specify that lead Federal agencies need not include the estimated intermediate and final completion dates of any such reviews or authorizations until the design of a project has sufficiently advanced so that they can be developed. In such cases, the guidance shall instruct lead Federal agencies to estimate when the project's design will be advanced enough to determine such dates. The timelines shall account for any federally required decisions or permits that are assumed by, or delegated to, State, tribal, or local agencies and the extent to which any approval or permit to be issued by a Federal agency is dependent upon the issuance of such a decision or permit.</p>
          <p id="p-51" data-page="40467">(C) CEQ and OMB shall also develop guidance for applying One Federal Decision whenever the lead agency is a State, tribal, or local agency exercising an assignment or delegation of an agency's NEPA responsibilities.</p>
