        <h1 id="h-1">Prioritizing and Allocating Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID-19</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="16227">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/4501?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 4501</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="16227">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy and Findings.</em> On March 13, 2020, I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 poses to our national security. In recognizing the public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) can be characterized as a pandemic. I also noted that while the Federal Government, along with State and local governments, have taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and to treat those affected, the spread of COVID-19 within our Nation's communities threatens to strain our Nation's healthcare system. To ensure that our healthcare system is able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID-19, it is critical that all health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19 are properly distributed to the Nation's healthcare system and others that need them most at this time.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="16227">Accordingly, I find that health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19, including personal protective equipment and ventilators, meet the criteria specified in section 101(b) of the Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/50/4511?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 4511</a>(b)). Under the delegation of authority provided in this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may identify additional specific health and medical resources that meet the criteria of section 101(b).</p>

          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Priorities and Allocation of Medical Resources.</em>
        </p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="16227">(a) Notwithstanding <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13603">Executive Order 13603</a> of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resource Preparedness), the authority of the President conferred by section 101 of the Act to require performance of contracts or orders (other than contracts of employment) to promote the national defense over performance of any other contracts or orders, to allocate materials, services, and facilities as deemed necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense, and to implement the Act in subchapter III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code, is delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to all health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States.</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="16227">(b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services may use the authority under section 101 of the Act to determine, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the heads of other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all health and medical resources, including controlling the distribution of such materials (including applicable services) in the civilian market, for responding to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States.</p>

        <p id="p-7" data-page="16227">(c) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue such orders and adopt and revise appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this order.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="16228"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-16228" data-page="16228" data-text="Start Printed Page 16228" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 16228}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 16228</span></span></span>
