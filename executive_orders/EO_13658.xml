          <HD SOURCE="HED">Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors</HD>

          <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and in order to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by contracting with sources who adequately compensate their workers, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> This order seeks to increase efficiency and cost savings in the work performed by parties who contract with the Federal Government by increasing to $10.10 the hourly minimum wage paid by those contractors. Raising the pay of low-wage workers increases their morale and the productivity and quality of their work, lowers turnover and its accompanying costs, and reduces supervisory costs. These savings and quality improvements will lead to improved economy and efficiency in Government procurement.</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 2</E>. <E T="03">Establishing a minimum wage for Federal contractors and subcontractors.</E> (a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that new contracts, contract-like instruments, and solicitations (collectively referred to as “contracts”), as described in section 7 of this order, include a clause, which the contractor and any subcontractors shall incorporate into lower-tier subcontracts, specifying, as a condition of payment, that the minimum wage to be paid to workers, including workers whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c), in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, shall be at least:</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) $10.10 per hour beginning January 1, 2015; and</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) beginning January 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary). The amount shall be published by the Secretary at least 90 days before such new minimum wage is to take effect and shall be:</FP>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(A) not less than the amount in effect on the date of such determination;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(B) increased from such amount by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (United States city average, all items, not seasonally adjusted), or its successor publication, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(C) rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05.</P>
          <P>(b) In calculating the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for purposes of subsection (a)(ii)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall compare such Consumer Price Index for the most recent month, quarter, or year available (as selected by the Secretary prior to the first year for which a minimum wage is in effect pursuant to subsection (a)(ii)(B)) with the Consumer Price Index for the same month in the preceding year, the same quarter in the preceding year, or the preceding year, respectively.</P>
          <P>(c) Nothing in this order shall excuse noncompliance with any applicable Federal or State prevailing wage law, or any applicable law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under this order.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 3</E>. <E T="03">Application to tipped workers.</E> (a) For workers covered by section 2 of this order who are tipped employees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 203(t), <PRTPAGE P="9852"/>the hourly cash wage that must be paid by an employer to such workers shall be at least:</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(i) $4.90 an hour, beginning on January 1, 2015;</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(ii) for each succeeding 1-year period until the hourly cash wage under this section equals 70 percent of the wage in effect under section 2 of this order for such period, an hourly cash wage equal to the amount determined under this section for the preceding year, increased by the lesser of:</FP>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(A) $0.95; or</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(B) the amount necessary for the hourly cash wage under this section to equal 70 percent of the wage under section 2 of this order; and</P>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(iii) for each subsequent year, 70 percent of the wage in effect under section 2 for such year rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05.</FP>

          <P>(b) Where workers do not receive a sufficient additional amount on account of tips, when combined with the hourly cash wage paid by the employer, such that their wages are equal to the minimum wage under section 2 of this order, the cash wage paid by the employer, as set forth in this section for those workers, shall be increased such that their wages equal the minimum wage under section 2 of this order. Consistent with applicable law, if the wage required to be paid under the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> or any other applicable law or regulation is higher than the wage required by section 2, the employer shall pay additional cash wages sufficient to meet the highest wage required to be paid.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 4</E>. <E T="03">Regulations and Implementation.</E> (a) The Secretary shall issue regulations by October 1, 2014, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, to implement the requirements of this order, including providing exclusions from the requirements set forth in this order where appropriate. To the extent permitted by law, within 60 days of the Secretary issuing such regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion of the contract clause in Federal procurement solicitations and contracts subject to this order.</FP>
          <P>(b) Within 60 days of the Secretary issuing regulations pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, agencies shall take steps, to the extent permitted by law, to exercise any applicable authority to ensure that contracts as described in section 7(d)(i)(C) and (D) of this order, entered into after January 1, 2015, consistent with the effective date of such agency action, comply with the requirements set forth in sections 2 and 3 of this order.</P>

          <P>(c) Any regulations issued pursuant to this section should, to the extent practicable and consistent with section 8 of this order, incorporate existing definitions, procedures, remedies, and enforcement processes under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201 <E T="03">et seq.;</E> the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701 <E T="03">et seq.;</E> and the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 3141 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
          </P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 5</E>. <E T="03">Enforcement.</E> (a) The Secretary shall have the authority for investigating potential violations of and obtaining compliance with this order.</FP>
          <P>(b) This order creates no rights under the Contract Disputes Act, and disputes regarding whether a contractor has paid the wages prescribed by this order, to the extent permitted by law, shall be disposed of only as provided by the Secretary in regulations issued pursuant to this order.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 6</E>. <E T="03">Severability.</E> If any provision of this order, or applying such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 7</E>. <E T="03">General Provisions.</E> (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</FP>

          <P>(e) For contracts or contract-like instruments covered by the Service Contract Act or the Davis-Bacon Act, this order shall apply only to contracts or contract-like instruments at the thresholds specified in those statutes.
