          <HD SOURCE="HED">Further Amendment to Executive Order 12958, as Amended, Classified National Security Information</HD>
          <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to further amend Executive Order 12958, as amended, it is hereby ordered that Executive Order 12958 is amended to read as follows: </FP>
          <FP>“Classified National Security Information</FP>
          <FP>This order prescribes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information, including information relating to defense against transnational terrorism. Our democratic principles require that the American people be informed of the activities of their Government. Also, our Nation's progress depends on the free flow of information. Nevertheless, throughout our history, the national defense has required that certain information be maintained in confidence in order to protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, our homeland security, and our interactions with foreign nations. Protecting information critical to our Nation's security remains a priority.</FP>
          <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
          <FP>PART 1—ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 1.1.</E>
            <E T="03">Classification Standards.</E> (a) Information may be originally classified under the terms of this order only if all of the following conditions are met:</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(1) an original classification authority is classifying the information;</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United States Government;</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of information listed in section 1.4 of this order; and</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security, which includes defense against transnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able to identify or describe the damage.</FP>
          <P>(b) Classified information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information.</P>
          <P>(c) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information is presumed to cause damage to the national security.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 1.2.</E>
            <E T="03">Classification Levels.</E> (a) Information may be classified at one of the following three levels:</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(1) “Top Secret” shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</FP>

          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(2) “Secret” shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the <PRTPAGE P="15316"/>national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(3) “Confidential” shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</FP>
          <P>(b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall be used to identify United States classified information.</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 1.3.</E>
            <E T="03">Classification Authority.</E> (a) The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by:</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(1) the President and, in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President;</FP>

          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(2) agency heads and officials designated by the President in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>; and</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</FP>
          <P>(b) Officials authorized to classify information at a specified level are also authorized to classify information at a lower level.</P>
          <P>(c) Delegation of original classification authority.</P>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to the minimum required to administer this order. Agency heads are responsible for ensuring that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and continuing need to exercise this authority.</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(2) “Top Secret” original classification authority may be delegated only by the President; in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(3) “Secret” or “Confidential” original classification authority may be delegated only by the President; in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or the senior agency official described in section 5.4(d) of this order, provided that official has been delegated “Top Secret” original classification authority by the agency head.</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be in writing and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in this order. Each delegation shall identify the official by name or position title.</FP>
          <P>(d) Original classification authorities must receive training in original classification as provided in this order and its implementing directives. Such training must include instruction on the proper safeguarding of classified information and of the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be brought against an individual who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.</P>

          <P>(e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of an agency who does not have original classification authority originates information believed by that person to require classification, the information shall be protected in a manner consistent with this order and its implementing directives. The information shall be transmitted promptly as provided under this order or its implementing directives to the agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority with respect to this information. That agency shall decide within 30 days whether to classify this information. If it is not clear which agency has classification responsibility for this information, it shall be sent to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. The Director shall determine the agency having primary subject matter interest and forward the information, with appropriate recommendations, to that agency for a classification determination.<PRTPAGE P="15317"/>

            <E T="04">Sec. 1.5.</E>
            <E T="03">Duration of Classification.</E> (a) At the time of original classification, the original classification authority shall attempt to establish a specific date or event for declassification based upon the duration of the national security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date or event, the information shall be automatically declassified. The date or event shall not exceed the time frame established in paragraph (b) of this section.</FP>
          <P>(b) If the original classification authority cannot determine an earlier specific date or event for declassification, information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it shall be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original decision. All information classified under this section shall be subject to section 3.3 of this order if it is contained in records of permanent historical value under title 44, United States Code.</P>
          <P>(c) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification, change the level of classification, or reclassify specific information only when the standards and procedures for classifying information under this order are followed.</P>
          <P>(d) Information marked for an indefinite duration of classification under predecessor orders, for example, marked as “Originating Agency's Determination Required,” or information classified under predecessor orders that contains no declassification instructions shall be declassified in accordance with part 3 of this order.</P>

          <P>(c) With respect to each classified document, the agency originating the document shall, by marking or other means, indicate which portions are classified, with the applicable classification level, and which portions are unclassified. In accordance with standards prescribed in directives issued under this order, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office may grant waivers of this requirement. The Director shall revoke any waiver upon a finding of abuse.</P>
          <P>(d) Markings implementing the provisions of this order, including abbreviations and requirements to safeguard classified working papers, shall conform to the standards prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this order.</P>
          <P>(e) Foreign government information shall retain its original classification markings or shall be assigned a U.S. classification that provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the entity that furnished the information. Foreign government information retaining its original classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. classification marking provided that the responsible agency determines that the foreign government markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings.</P>
          <P>(f) Information assigned a level of classification under this or predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings. Whenever such information is used in the derivative classification process or is reviewed for possible declassification, holders of such information shall coordinate with an appropriate classification authority for the application of omitted markings.</P>
          <P>(g) The classification authority shall, whenever practicable, use a classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified document.</P>

          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(2) the information may be reasonably recovered; and</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.</FP>

          <P>(d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section 3.5 of this order only if such classification meets the requirements of this order and is accomplished on a document-by-document basis with <PRTPAGE P="15319"/>the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4 of this order.</P>
          <P>(e) Compilations of items of information that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the standards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information. As used in this order, “compilation” means an aggregation of pre-existing unclassified items of information.</P>

          <P>(b) In accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant to this order, an agency head or senior agency official shall establish procedures under which authorized holders of information are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification of information that they believe is improperly classified or unclassified. These procedures shall ensure that:</P>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such actions;</FP>

            <E T="04">Sec. 3.1.</E>
            <E T="03">Authority for Declassification.</E> (a) Information shall be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for classification under this order.<PRTPAGE P="15320"/>
          </FP>
          <P>(b) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the classification requirements under this order requires continued protection. In some exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or the senior agency official. That official will determine, as an exercise of discretion, whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to the national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure. This provision does not:</P>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification; or</FP>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.</FP>
          <P>(c) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office determines that information is classified in violation of this order, the Director may require the information to be declassified by the agency that originated the classification. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal.</P>
          <P>(d) The provisions of this section shall also apply to agencies that, under the terms of this order, do not have original classification authority, but had such authority under predecessor orders.</P>

            <E T="03">Transferred Records.</E> (a) In the case of classified records transferred in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not merely for storage purposes, the receiving agency shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order.</FP>
          <P>(b) In the case of classified records that are not officially transferred as described in paragraph (a) of this section, but that originated in an agency that has ceased to exist and for which there is no successor agency, each agency in possession of such records shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order. Such records may be declassified or downgraded by the agency in possession after consultation with any other agency that has an interest in the subject matter of the records.</P>
          <P>(c) Classified records accessioned into the National Archives and Records Administration (National Archives) as of the effective date of this order shall be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist of the United States (Archivist) in accordance with this order, the directives issued pursuant to this order, agency declassification guides, and any existing procedural agreement between the Archivist and the relevant agency head.</P>
          <P>(d) The originating agency shall take all reasonable steps to declassify classified information contained in records determined to have permanent historical value before they are accessioned into the National Archives. However, the Archivist may require that classified records be accessioned into the National Archives when necessary to comply with the provisions of the Federal Records Act. This provision does not apply to records being transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 2203 of title 44, United States Code, or records for which the National Archives serves as the custodian of the records of an agency or organization that has gone out of existence.</P>
          <P>(e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt a system of records management that will facilitate the public release of documents at the time such documents are declassified pursuant to the provisions for automatic declassification in section 3.3 of this order.</P>

The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt the information or to declassify it at an earlier date than recommended. The agency head may appeal such a decision to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The information will remain classified while such an appeal is pending.</FP>
          <P>(e) The following provisions shall apply to the onset of automatic declassification:</P>
          <FP SOURCE="FP1">(1) Classified records within an integral file block, as defined in this order, that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under this section shall not be automatically declassified until December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the file block.</FP>
