        <h1 id="h-1">Protecting Vulnerable Newborn and Infant Children</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="62187">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="62187">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> Every infant born alive, no matter the circumstances of his or her birth, has the same dignity and the same rights as every other individual and is entitled to the same protections under Federal law. Such laws include the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), <a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/1395?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">42 U.S.C. 1395</a>dd, which guarantees, in hospitals that have an emergency department, each individual's right to an appropriate medical screening examination and to either stabilizing treatment or an appropriate transfer. They also include section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Rehab Act), <a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/29/794?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">29 U.S.C. 794</a>, which prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by programs and activities receiving Federal funding. In addition, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, <a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/1/8?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">1 U.S.C. 8</a>, makes clear that all infants born alive are individuals for purposes of these and other Federal laws and are therefore afforded the same legal protections as any other person. Together, these laws help protect infants born alive from discrimination in the provision of medical treatment, including infants who require emergency medical treatment, who are premature, or who are born with disabilities. Such infants are entitled to meaningful and non-discriminatory access to medical examination and services, with the consent of a parent or guardian, when they present at hospitals receiving Federal funds.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="62187">Despite these laws, some hospitals refuse the required medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment or otherwise do not provide potentially lifesaving medical treatment to extremely premature or disabled infants, even when parents plead for such treatment. Hospitals might refuse to provide treatment to extremely premature infants&mdash;born alive before 24 weeks of gestation&mdash;because they believe these infants may not survive, may have to live with long-term disabilities, or may have a quality-of-life deemed to be inadequate. Active treatment of extremely premature infants has, however, been shown to improve their survival rates. And the denial of such treatment, or discouragement of parents from seeking such treatment for their children, devalues the lives of these children and may violate Federal law.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="62187">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of the United States to recognize the human dignity and inherent worth of every newborn or other infant child, regardless of prematurity or disability, and to ensure for each child due protection under the law.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="62187">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) shall ensure that individuals responsible for all programs and activities under his jurisdiction that receive Federal funding are aware of their obligations toward infants, including premature infants or infants with disabilities, who have an emergency medical condition in need of stabilizing treatment, under EMTALA and section 504 of the Rehab Act, as interpreted consistent with the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act. In particular, the Secretary shall ensure that individuals responsible for such programs and activities are aware that they are not excused from complying with these obligations, including the obligation to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment or transfer, when extremely premature infants are born alive or infants are born with disabilities. The Secretary shall also ensure <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="62188"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element document-markup bootstrap-popover" id="page-62188" data-page="62188" data-text="Start Printed Page 62188" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-toggle="popover" data-original-title="" data-placement="left" data-html="true" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 62188}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text cj-tooltip" data-tooltip="Click for more print page information">Start Printed Page 62188</span></span></span>that individuals responsible for such programs and activities are aware that they may not unlawfully discourage parents from seeking medical treatment for their infant child solely because of their infant child's disability. The Secretary shall further ensure that individuals responsible for such programs and activities are aware of their obligations to provide stabilizing treatment that will allow the infant patients to be transferred to a more suitable facility if appropriate treatment is not possible at the initial location.</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="62188">(b) The Secretary shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, ensure that Federal funding disbursed by the Department of Health and Human Services is expended in full compliance with EMTALA and section 504 of the Rehab Act, as interpreted consistent with the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, as reflected in the policy set forth in section 2 of this order.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-7" data-page="62188">(i) The Secretary shall, as appropriate and to the fullest extent permitted by law, investigate complaints of violations of applicable Federal laws with respect to infants born alive, including infants who have an emergency medical condition in need of stabilizing treatment or infants with disabilities whose parents seek medical treatment for their infants. The Secretary shall also clarify, in an easily understandable format, the process by which parents and hospital staff may submit such complaints for investigation under applicable Federal laws.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-8" data-page="62188">(ii) The Secretary shall take all appropriate enforcement action against individuals and organizations found through investigation to have violated applicable Federal laws, up to and including terminating Federal funding for non-compliant programs and activities.</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="62188">(c) The Secretary shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, prioritize the allocation of Department of Health and Human Services discretionary grant funding and National Institutes of Health research dollars for programs and activities conducting research to develop treatments that may improve survival&mdash;especially survival without impairment&mdash;of infants born alive, including premature infants or infants with disabilities, who have an emergency medical condition in need of stabilizing treatment.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="62188">(d) The Secretary shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, prioritize the allocation of Department of Health and Human Services discretionary grant funding to programs and activities, including hospitals, that provide training to medical personnel regarding the provision of life-saving medical treatment to all infants born alive, including premature infants or infants with disabilities, who have an emergency medical condition in need of stabilizing treatment.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="62188">(e) The Secretary shall, as necessary and consistent with applicable law, issue such regulations or guidance as may be necessary to implement this order.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="62188">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. <em>General Provisions.</em> (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
