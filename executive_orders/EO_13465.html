          <h1 id="h-1">Amending <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12989">Executive Order 12989,</a> as Amended</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="33285">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including subsection 121(a) of title 40 and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to take further steps to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows: </p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="33285">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong> <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12989">Executive Order 12989</a> of February 13, 1996, as amended, is further amended: </p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="33285">(a) by striking the title and inserting in lieu thereof &ldquo;Economy and Efficiency in Government Procurement Through Compliance with Certain Immigration and Nationality Act Provisions and Use of an Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification System&rdquo;; and </p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="33285">(b) by striking the material that follows the title and precedes section 1 of the order and inserting in lieu thereof the following: </p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="33285">&ldquo;This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement. Stability and dependability are important elements of economy and efficiency. A contractor whose workforce is less stable will be less likely to produce goods and services economically and efficiently than a contractor whose workforce is more stable. It is the policy of the executive branch to enforce fully the immigration laws of the United States, including the detection and removal of illegal aliens and the imposition of legal sanctions against employers that hire illegal aliens. Because of the worksite enforcement policy of the United States and the underlying obligation of the executive branch to enforce the immigration laws, contractors that employ illegal aliens cannot rely on the continuing availability and service of those illegal workers, and such contractors inevitably will have a less stable and less dependable workforce than contractors that do not employ such persons. Where a contractor assigns illegal aliens to work on Federal contracts, the enforcement of Federal immigration laws imposes a direct risk of disruption, delay, and increased expense in Federal contracting. Such contractors are less dependable procurement sources, even if they do not knowingly hire or knowingly continue to employ unauthorized workers. </p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="33285">&ldquo;Contractors that adopt rigorous employment eligibility confirmation policies are much less likely to face immigration enforcement actions, because they are less likely to employ unauthorized workers, and they are therefore generally more efficient and dependable procurement sources than contractors that do not employ the best available measures to verify the work eligibility of their workforce. It is the policy of the executive branch to use an electronic employment verification system because, among other reasons, it provides the best available means to confirm the identity and work eligibility of all employees that join the Federal workforce. Private employers that choose to contract with the Federal Government should meet the same standard. </p>

          <p id="p-7" data-page="33285">&ldquo;I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy of contracting only with providers that do not knowingly employ unauthorized alien workers and that have agreed to utilize an electronic employment verification system designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security to confirm the employment eligibility of their workforce will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="33286"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-33286" data-page="33286" data-text="Start Printed Page 33286" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 33286}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 33286</span></span></span>
