Accordingly, I hereby terminate the national emergencies declared in those orders and revoke those and all related orders (Executive Orders 12810 of June 5, 1992, 12831 of January 15, 1993, 12846 of April 25, 1993, 12934 of October 25, 1994, 13121 of April 30, 1999, and 13192 of January 17, 2001). At the same time, and in order to take additional steps with respect to continuing, widespread, and illicit actions that obstruct implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001, relating to Macedonia, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, relating to Kosovo, or the Dayton Accords or the Conclusions of the Peace Implementation Conference Council held in London on December 8-9, 1995, including the decisions or conclusions of the High Representative, the Peace Implementation Council or its Steering Board, relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the harboring of individuals indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the national emergency described and declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13219">Executive Order 13219</a> of June 26, 2001, I hereby order:</p>
