          <h1 id="h-1">White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="42683">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve Hispanic Americans' access to educational and economic opportunities, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="42683">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> The success of Hispanic Americans is integral to the economic future of our country. As more than 60 million Hispanics live in the United States today, Hispanics are the largest minority group in the country. Hispanics are also the Nation's youngest major racial or ethnic group. Generations of Hispanics constituting different backgrounds and cultures have contributed to building a strong and prosperous America. Their collective contributions continue a legacy of inspiration that is a cherished part of the American experience.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="42683">While we celebrate the many ways Hispanic Americans have contributed to our Nation, we also recognize that they face challenges in accessing educational and economic opportunities. In the last 3 years, my Administration has supported school choice, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and new career pathways, including apprenticeships and work-based learning initiatives, because quality education options offering multiple pathways to economic success are critical to developing our Nation's potential for the jobs of tomorrow. My Administration has also supported investment in economically distressed communities, including through Opportunity Zones, and economic opportunities for small and minority-owned businesses. The initiative set forth in this order increases emphasis on the connection between educational and economic opportunities, and exploring and promoting opportunities for Hispanic Americans, both through and outside traditional education options, that lead to economic prosperity. Today, Americans have more paths to prosperity than any previous generation, and it is necessary to ensure that Hispanic Americans have every opportunity to access these pathways and to fulfill their educational and economic aspirations.</p>
