        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13837">Executive Order 13837</a> of May 25, 2018
        <h1 id="h-1">Ensuring Transparency, Accountability, and Efficiency in Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Use</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="25335">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, and to ensure the effective functioning of the executive branch, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="25335">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose</em>. An effective and efficient government keeps careful track of how it spends the taxpayers' money and eliminates unnecessary, inefficient, or unreasonable expenditures. To advance this policy, executive branch employees should spend their duty hours performing the work of the Federal Government and serving the public.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="25335">Federal law allows Federal employees to represent labor organizations and perform other non-agency business while being paid by American taxpayers (taxpayer-funded union time). The Congress, however, has also instructed the executive branch to interpret the law in a manner consistent with the requirements of an effective and efficient government.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="25335">To that end, agencies should ensure that taxpayer-funded union time is used efficiently and authorized in amounts that are reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest. Federal employees should spend the clear majority of their duty hours working for the public. No agency should pay for Federal labor organizations' expenses, except where required by law. Agencies should eliminate unrestricted grants of taxpayer-funded union time and instead require employees to obtain specific authorization before using such time. Agencies should also monitor use of taxpayer-funded union time, ensure it is used only for authorized purposes, and make information regarding its use readily available to the public.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="25335">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Definitions</em>. For purposes of this order, the following definitions shall apply:</p>

        <p id="p-7" data-page="25335">(b) &ldquo;Agency business&rdquo; shall mean work performed by Federal employees, including detailees or assignees, on behalf of an agency, but does not include work performed on taxpayer-funded union time.</p>

        <p id="p-11" data-page="25336">(f) &ldquo;Grievance&rdquo; has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(9) of title 5, United States Code.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="25336">(g) &ldquo;Labor organization&rdquo; has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(4) of title 5, United States Code.</p>

        <p id="p-16" data-page="25336">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. <em>Standards for Reasonable and Efficient Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Usage</em>. (a) No agency shall agree to authorize any amount of taxpayer-funded union time under section 7131(d) of title 5, United States Code, unless such time is reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest. Agreements authorizing taxpayer-funded union time under section 7131(d) of title 5, United States Code, that would cause the union time rate in a bargaining unit to exceed 1 hour should, taking into account the size of the bargaining unit, and the amount of taxpayer-funded union time anticipated to be granted under sections 7131(a) and 7131(c) of title 5, United States Code, ordinarily not be considered reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest, or to satisfy the &ldquo;effective and efficient&rdquo; goal set forth in section 1 of this order and section 7101(b) of title 5, United States Code. Agencies shall commit the time and resources necessary to strive for a negotiated union time rate of 1 hour or less, and to fulfill their obligation to bargain in good faith.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="25336">(b) (i) If an agency agrees to authorize amounts of taxpayer-funded union time under section 7131(d) of title 5, United States Code, that would cause the union time rate in a bargaining unit to exceed 1 hour (or proposes to the Federal Service Impasses Panel or an arbitrator engaging in interest arbitration an amount that would cause the union time rate in a bargaining unit to exceed 1 hour), the agency head shall report this agreement or proposal to the President through the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM Director) within 15 days of such an agreement or proposal. Such report shall explain why such expenditures are reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest, describe the benefit (if any) the public will receive from the activities conducted by employees on such taxpayer-funded union time, and identify the total cost of such time to the agency. This reporting duty cannot be delegated.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-18" data-page="25336">(ii) Each agency head shall require relevant subordinate agency officials to inform the agency head 5 business days in advance of presenting or accepting a proposal that would result in a union time rate of greater than 1 hour for any bargaining unit, if the subordinate agency officials anticipate they will present or agree to such a provision.</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-19" data-page="25336">(iii) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to a union time rate established pursuant to an order of the Federal Service Impasses Panel or an arbitrator engaging in interest arbitration, provided that the agency had proposed that the Impasses Panel or arbitrator establish a union time rate of 1 hour or less.</p>

        <p id="p-20" data-page="25336">(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any agency from authorizing taxpayer-funded union time as required under sections 7131(a) and 7131(c) of title 5, United States Code, or to direct an agency to negotiate to include in a collective bargaining agreement a term that precludes an agency from granting taxpayer-funded union time pursuant to those provisions.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="25337"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-25337" data-page="25337" data-text="Start Printed Page 25337" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 25337}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 25337</span></span></span>
