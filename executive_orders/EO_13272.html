        <h1 id="h-1">Proper Consideration of Small Entities in Agency Rulemaking</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="53461">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="53461">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em> General Requirements.</em> Each agency shall establish procedures and policies to promote compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=5&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">5 U.S.C. 601</a> <em>et seq</em>.) (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;). Agencies shall thoroughly review draft rules to assess and take appropriate account of the potential impact on small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small organizations, as provided by the Act. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (Advocacy) shall remain available to advise agencies in performing that review consistent with the provisions of the Act.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="53461">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
          <em> Responsibilities of Advocacy.</em> Consistent with the requirements of the Act, other applicable law, and Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended, Advocacy:</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="53461">(a) shall notify agency heads from time to time of the requirements of the Act, including by issuing notifications with respect to the basic requirements of the Act within 90 days of the date of this order;</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="53461">(b) shall provide training to agencies on compliance with the Act; and</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="53461">(c) may provide comment on draft rules to the agency that has proposed or intends to propose the rules and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget (OIRA).</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="53461">
          <strong>Sec. 3.</strong>
          <em> Responsibilities of Federal Agencies.</em> Consistent with the requirements of the Act and applicable law, agencies shall:</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="53461">(a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, issue written procedures and policies, consistent with the Act, to ensure that the potential impacts of agencies' draft rules on small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small organizations are properly considered during the rulemaking process. Agency heads shall submit, no later than 90 days from the date of this order, their written procedures and policies to Advocacy for comment. Prior to issuing final procedures and policies, agencies shall consider any such comments received within 60 days from the date of the submission of the agencies' procedures and policies to Advocacy. Except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by statute or Executive Order, agencies shall make the final procedures and policies available to the public through the Internet or other easily accessible means;</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="53461">(b) Notify Advocacy of any draft rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Act. Such notifications shall be made (i) when the agency submits a draft rule to OIRA under Executive Order 12866 if that order requires such submission, or (ii) if no submission to OIRA is so required, at a reasonable time prior to publication of the rule by the agency; and</p>

        <p id="p-10" data-page="53461">(c) Give every appropriate consideration to any comments provided by Advocacy regarding a draft rule. Consistent with applicable law and appropriate protection of executive deliberations and legal privileges, an agency shall include, in any explanation or discussion accompanying publication in the <strong>Federal Register</strong> of a final rule, the agency's response to any written comments submitted by Advocacy on the proposed rule that preceded the <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="53462"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-53462" data-page="53462" data-text="Start Printed Page 53462" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 53462}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 53462</span></span></span>final rule; provided, however, that such inclusion is not required if the head of the agency certifies that the public interest is not served thereby.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="53462">Agencies and Advocacy may, to the extent permitted by law, engage in an exchange of data and research, as appropriate, to foster the purposes of the Act.</p>
