        <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13578 of July 6, 2011</EXECORDR>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">Coordinating Policies on Automotive Communities and Workers</HD>
        <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
          <E T="03">Policy.</E> Over the last decade, the United States has experienced a decline in employment in the automotive industry and among part suppliers.  This decline accelerated dramatically from 2008 to 2009, with more than 400,000 jobs being lost in the industry.  Now, 2 years later, the American automotive industry is beginning to recover.  The automotive industry has, over the past 2 years, experienced its strongest period of job growth since the late 1990s.  Exports have expanded, and the domestic automakers in 2010 gained market share for the first time since 1995.  The automotive supply chain, which employs three times as many workers as the automakers, has also shown renewed strength.  However, we still have a long way to go.</FP>
        <FP>Over the past 2 years my Administration has undertaken coordinated efforts on behalf of automotive communities, including targeted technical and financial assistance.  For example, the Department of Labor set aside funds for green jobs and job training for high-growth sectors of the economy specifically targeted to communities affected by the automotive downturn, and the Department of Commerce provided funds specifically for automotive communities to develop plans for economic recovery.  Stabilizing the automotive industry will also require the use of expanded strategies by automotive communities that include land-use redevelopment, small business support, and worker training.</FP>
        <FP>The purpose of this order is to continue the coordinated Federal response to factors affecting automotive communities and workers and to ensure that Federal programs and policies address these concerns.</FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E>
