        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13750">Executive Order 13750</a> of November 29, 2016
        <h1 id="h-1">Providing for the Appointment of Alumni of the Fulbright U.S. Student Program, the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program, and the Critical Language Scholarship Program to the Competitive Service</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="87393">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="87393">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> The Federal Government benefits from a workforce that can be recruited from the broadest and deepest pools of qualified candidates for our highly competitive, merit-based positions. The issuance of an order granting Non-Competitive Eligibility (NCE) to certain alumni of the Fulbright U.S. Student Program, the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program, and the Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) Program, all of which are academic exchange programs carried out under the authorities of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, Public Law 87-256, as amended, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act, and the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000, title III of <a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=106&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=309&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 106-309</a>, would be in the best interest of the Federal Government. Participants in these programs develop advanced- to superior-level skills in languages and cultural competence in regions that are strategically, diplomatically, and economically important to the United States. It is in the interest of the Federal Government to retain the services of these highly skilled individuals, particularly given that the Federal Government aided them in the acquisition of their skills. Participants in the Fulbright, Gilman, and CLS programs are drawn from highly competitive, merit-based national selection processes to which a veterans' preference applies to ensure that the most qualified individuals are selected.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="87393">Accordingly, pursuant to my authority under <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=5&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=3302&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">5 U.S.C. 3302</a>(1), and in order to achieve a workforce that is drawn from all segments of society as provided in <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=5&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=2301&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">5 U.S.C. 2301</a>(b)(1), I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules for certain positions in the Federal civil service.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="87393">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Establishment.</em> The head of any agency in the executive branch may appoint in the competitive service any person who is certified by the Secretary of State or designee as having participated successfully in the Fulbright, Gilman, or CLS international exchange programs, and who passes such examination as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may prescribe.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="87393">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. The Secretary of State or designee shall issue certificates, upon request, to persons whom the Department of State determines have completed the requirements of a program described in section 1 of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="87393">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. Any appointment under this order shall be effected within a period of 1 year after completion of the appointee's participation in the programs described in section 1. Such period may be extended to not more than 3 years for persons who, following participation in the programs described in section 1, are engaged in military service, in the pursuit of studies at an institution of higher learning, or in other activities which, in the view of the appointing authority, warrant an extension of such period. <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="87394"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-87394" data-page="87394" data-text="Start Printed Page 87394" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 87394}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 87394</span></span></span>Such period may also be extended to permit the adjudication of a background investigation.</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="87394">
          <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. A person appointed under section 2 of this order becomes a career conditional employee.</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="87394">
          <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. Any law, Executive Order, or regulation that would disqualify an applicant for appointment in the competitive service shall also disqualify an applicant for appointment under this order. Examples of disqualifying criteria include restrictions on employing persons who are not U.S. citizens or nationals, who have violated the anti-nepotism provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=5&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=2302&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">5 U.S.C. 2302</a>(b)(7), 3110, who have knowingly and willfully failed to register for Selective Service when required to do so, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=5&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=3328&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">5 U.S.C. 3328</a>(a)(2), who do not meet occupational qualifying standards prescribed by OPM, or who do not meet suitability factors prescribed by OPM.</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="87394">
          <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. The Office of Personnel Management is authorized to issue such additional regulations as may be necessary to implement this order. Any individual who meets the terms of this order, however, is eligible for noncompetitive hiring with or without additional regulations.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="87394">
          <strong>Sec. 8</strong>. <em>General Provisions.</em> (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
        (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or

        <p id="p-13" data-page="87394">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="87394">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
