          <p id="p-15" data-page="26410">
            <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in subsection 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>

            <strong>Sec. 6.</strong> Nothing in section 1 of this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.</p>
          <p id="p-19" data-page="26410">
            <strong>Sec. 7.</strong> For the purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-20" data-page="26410">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="26410">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>

          <p id="p-23" data-page="26410">(d) the term &ldquo;deceptive transaction&rdquo; means any transaction where the identity of any person subject to United States sanctions concerning Iran or Syria is withheld or obscured from other participants in the transaction or any relevant regulatory authorities;</p>

          <p id="p-24" data-page="26410">(e) the term &ldquo;person subject to United States sanctions concerning Iran or Syria&rdquo; means (i) any person, including the Government of Iran or the Government of Syria, with whom transactions are restricted pursuant to any Executive Order relating to the national emergencies declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957</a> of March 15, 1995, or in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13338">Executive Order 13338</a> of May 11, 2004, as modified in scope in subsequent Executive Orders, or (ii) <span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-26411" data-page="26411" data-text="Start Printed Page 26411" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 26411}'> </span></span>any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to IEEPA in connection with Iran's or Syria's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction, or Iran's or Syria's support for international terrorism;</p>
          <p id="p-25" data-page="26411">(f) the term &ldquo;Government of Iran&rdquo; means the Government of Iran, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of Iran, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran; and</p>

          <p id="p-27" data-page="26411">
            <strong>Sec. 8.</strong> For those persons subject to the measures described in section 1 of this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergencies identified in the preamble to this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-28" data-page="26411">
            <strong>Sec. 9.</strong> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="26411">
            <strong>Sec. 10.</strong> This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
          <p id="p-30" data-page="26411">
            <strong>Sec. 11.</strong> The measures taken pursuant to this order with respect to Iran are in response to actions of the Government of Iran occurring after the conclusion of the 1981 Algiers Accords, and are intended solely as a response to those later actions.</p>
