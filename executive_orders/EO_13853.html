          <h1 id="h-1">Establishing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="65071">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="65071">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> Fifty-two million Americans live in economically distressed communities. Despite the growing national economy, these communities are plagued by high poverty levels, failing schools, and a scarcity of jobs. In December 2017, I signed into law a bill originally introduced as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Act), which established a historic new Federal tax incentive that promotes long-term equity investments in low-income communities designated as &ldquo;qualified opportunity zones&rdquo; by the Governors of States or territories. In order to further facilitate such investment, my Administration will implement reforms that streamline existing regulations, protect taxpayers by optimizing use of Federal resources, stimulate economic opportunity and mobility, encourage entrepreneurship, expand quality educational opportunities, develop and rehabilitate quality housing stock, promote workforce development, and promote safety and prevent crime in urban and economically distressed communities.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="65071">This order establishes a White House Council to carry out my Administration's plan to encourage public and private investment in urban and economically distressed areas, including qualified opportunity zones. The Council shall lead joint efforts across executive departments and agencies (agencies) to engage with State, local, and tribal governments to find ways to better use public funds to revitalize urban and economically distressed communities.</p>
