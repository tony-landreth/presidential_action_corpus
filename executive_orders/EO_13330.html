          <h1 id="h-1">Human Service Transportation Coordination</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="9185">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to enhance access to transportation to improve mobility, employment opportunities, and access to community services for persons who are transportation-disadvantaged, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="9185">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong> This order is issued consistent with the following findings and principles:</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="9185">(a) A strong America depends on citizens who are productive and who actively participate in the life of their communities.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="9185">(b) Transportation plays a critical role in providing access to employment, medical and health care, education, and other community services and amenities. The importance of this role is underscored by the variety of transportation programs that have been created in conjunction with health and human service programs, and by the significant Federal investment in accessible public transportation systems throughout the Nation.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="9185">(c) These transportation resources, however, are often difficult for citizens to understand and access, and are more costly than necessary due to inconsistent and unnecessary Federal and State program rules and restrictions.</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="9185">(d) A broad range of Federal program funding allows for the purchase or provision of transportation services and resources for persons who are transportation-disadvantaged. Yet, in too many communities, these services and resources are fragmented, unused, or altogether unavailable.</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="9185">(e) Federally assisted community transportation services should be seamless, comprehensive, and accessible to those who rely on them for their lives and livelihoods. For persons with mobility limitations related to advanced age, persons with disabilities, and persons struggling for self-sufficiency, transportation within and between our communities should be as available and affordable as possible.</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="9185">(f) The development, implementation, and maintenance of responsive, comprehensive, coordinated community transportation systems is essential for persons with disabilities, persons with low incomes, and older adults who rely on such transportation to fully participate in their communities.</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="9185">

          <p id="p-10" data-page="9185">(b) For the purposes of this order, persons who are transportation-disadvantaged are persons who qualify for Federally conducted or Federally assisted transportation-related programs or services due to disability, income, or advanced age.</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="9185">
