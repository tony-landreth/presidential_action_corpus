          <p id="p-7" data-page="6877">1-201. Definitions.</p>
          (a)
          The term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; shall include an employee, applicant for employment, or former employee covered by section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=42&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=2000&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">42 U.S.C. 2000</a>e-16).
          (b)
          Genetic monitoring means the periodic examination of employees to evaluate acquired modifications to their genetic material, such as chromosomal damage or evidence of increased occurrence of mutations, that may have developed in the course of employment due to exposure to toxic substances in the workplace, in order to identify, evaluate, respond to the effects of, or control adverse environmental exposures in the workplace.
          (c)

          Genetic services means health services, including genetic tests, provided to obtain, assess, or interpret genetic information for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, or for genetic education or counseling.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="6878"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-6878" data-page="6878" data-text="Start Printed Page 6878" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 6878}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 6878</span></span></span>
          
          (d)
          Genetic test means the analysis of human DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, or certain metabolites in order to detect disease-related genotypes or mutations. Tests for metabolites fall within the definition of &ldquo;genetic tests&rdquo; when an excess or deficiency of the metabolites indicates the presence of a mutation or mutations. The conducting of metabolic tests by a department or agency that are not intended to reveal the presence of a mutation shall not be considered a violation of this order, regardless of the results of the tests. Test results revealing a mutation shall, however, be subject to the provisions of this order.
          (e)
          Protected genetic information.
          (1)
          In general, protected genetic information means:

          information about the genetic tests of an individual's family members; or
          (C)
          information about the occurrence of a disease, or medical condition or disorder in family members of the individual.
          (2)
          Information about an individual's current health status (including information about sex, age, physical exams, and chemical, blood, or urine analyses) is not protected genetic information unless it is described in subparagraph (1).

          (a)
          The employing department or agency shall not discharge, fail or refuse to hire, or otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to the compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment of that employee, because of protected genetic information with respect to the employee, or because of information about a request for or the receipt of genetic services by such employee.
          (b)
          The employing department or agency shall not limit, segregate, or classify employees in any way that would deprive or tend to deprive any employee of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect that employee's status, because of protected genetic information with respect to the employee or because of information about a request for or the receipt of genetic services by such employee.
          (c)
          The employing department or agency shall not request, require, collect, or purchase protected genetic information with respect to an employee, or information about a request for or the receipt of genetic services by such employee.

          if required by a Federal statute, congressional subpoena, or an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, except that if the subpoena or court order was secured without the knowledge of the individual to whom the information refers, the employer shall provide the individual with adequate notice to challenge the subpoena or court order, unless the subpoena or court order also imposes confidentiality requirements; or
          (4)

          to executive branch officials investigating compliance with this order, if the information is relevant to the investigation.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="6879"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-6879" data-page="6879" data-text="Start Printed Page 6879" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 6879}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 6879</span></span></span>
