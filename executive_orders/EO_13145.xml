          <HD SOURCE="HED">To Prohibit Discrimination in Federal Employment Based on Genetic Information</HD>
          <FP>By the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is ordered as follows:</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
            <E T="03"> Nondiscrimination in Federal Employment on the Basis of Protected Genetic Information.</E>
          </FP>
          <P>1-101. It is the policy of the Government of the United States to provide equal employment opportunity in Federal employment for all qualified persons and to prohibit discrimination against employees based on protected genetic information, or information about a request for or the receipt of genetic services. This policy of equal opportunity applies to every aspect of Federal employment.</P>
          <P>1-102. The head of each Executive department and agency shall extend the policy set forth in section 1-101 to all its employees covered by section 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16).</P>
          <P>1-103. Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this order to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their statutory and regulatory authorities, and their enforcement mechanisms.

            <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E>
            <E T="03"> Requirements Applicable to Employing Departments and Agencies.</E>
          </FP>

          <ST1>(b)</ST1>
          <TXT>Genetic monitoring means the periodic examination of employees to evaluate acquired modifications to their genetic material, such as chromosomal damage or evidence of increased occurrence of mutations, that may have developed in the course of employment due to exposure to toxic substances in the workplace, in order to identify, evaluate, respond to the effects of, or control adverse environmental exposures in the workplace.</TXT>
          <ST1>(c)</ST1>

          <TXT>Genetic services means health services, including genetic tests, provided to obtain, assess, or interpret genetic information for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, or for genetic education or counseling.<PRTPAGE P="6878"/>

          <TXT>Genetic test means the analysis of human DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, or certain metabolites in order to detect disease-related genotypes or mutations. Tests for metabolites fall within the definition of “genetic tests” when an excess or deficiency of the metabolites indicates the presence of a mutation or mutations. The conducting of metabolic tests by a department or agency that are not intended to reveal the presence of a mutation shall not be considered a violation of this order, regardless of the results of the tests. Test results revealing a mutation shall, however, be subject to the provisions of this order.</TXT>
