        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13768">Executive Order 13768</a> of January 25, 2017
        <h1 id="h-1">Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="8799">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=8&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1101&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1101</a> <em>et seq.</em>), and in order to ensure the public safety of the American people in communities across the United States as well as to ensure that our Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby declare the policy of the executive branch to be, and order, as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="8799">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> Interior enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety. This is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="8799">Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="8799">Tens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities across the country, solely because their home countries refuse to accept their repatriation. Many of these aliens are criminals who have served time in our Federal, State, and local jails. The presence of such individuals in the United States, and the practices of foreign nations that refuse the repatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="8799">Although Federal immigration law provides a framework for Federal-State partnerships in enforcing our immigration laws to ensure the removal of aliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="8799">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of the executive branch to:</p>
        
        <p id="p-7" data-page="8799">(a) Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="8799">(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="8799">(c) Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="8799">(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="8799">(e) Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.</p>
        
        <p id="p-12" data-page="8799">

        <p id="p-25" data-page="8800">(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=8&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1357&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1357</a>(g)).</p>
