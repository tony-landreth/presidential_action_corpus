        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13792">Executive Order 13792</a> of April 26, 2017
        <h1 id="h-1">Review of Designations Under the Antiquities Act</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="20429">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in recognition of the importance of the Nation's wealth of natural resources to American workers and the American economy, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="20429">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> Designations of national monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906, recently recodified at sections 320301 to 320303 of title 54, United States Code (the &ldquo;Antiquities Act&rdquo; or &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), have a substantial impact on the management of Federal lands and the use and enjoyment of neighboring lands. Such designations are a means of stewarding America's natural resources, protecting America's natural beauty, and preserving America's historic places. Monument designations that result from a lack of public outreach and proper coordination with State, tribal, and local officials and other relevant stakeholders may also create barriers to achieving energy independence, restrict public access to and use of Federal lands, burden State, tribal, and local governments, and otherwise curtail economic growth. Designations should be made in accordance with the requirements and original objectives of the Act and appropriately balance the protection of landmarks, structures, and objects against the appropriate use of Federal lands and the effects on surrounding lands and communities.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="20429">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Review of National Monument Designations.</em> (a) The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall conduct a review of all Presidential designations or expansions of designations under the Antiquities Act made since January 1, 1996, where the designation covers more than 100,000 acres, where the designation after expansion covers more than 100,000 acres, or where the Secretary determines that the designation or expansion was made without adequate public outreach and coordination with relevant stakeholders, to determine whether each designation or expansion conforms to the policy set forth in section 1 of this order. In making those determinations, the Secretary shall consider:</p>

        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-5" data-page="20429">(ii) whether designated lands are appropriately classified under the Act as &ldquo;historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects of historic or scientific interest&rdquo;;</p>
