        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13706">Executive Order 13706</a> of September 7, 2015
        <h1 id="h-1">Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal Contractors</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="54697">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=40&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=121&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">40 U.S.C. 121</a>, and in order to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by contracting with sources that allow their employees to earn paid sick leave, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="54697">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em>Policy.</em> This order seeks to increase efficiency and cost savings in the work performed by parties that contract with the Federal Government by ensuring that employees on those contracts can earn up to 7 days or more of paid sick leave annually, including paid leave allowing for family care. Providing access to paid sick leave will improve the health and performance of employees of Federal contractors and bring benefits packages at Federal contractors in line with model employers, ensuring that they remain competitive employers in the search for dedicated and talented employees. These savings and quality improvements will lead to improved economy and efficiency in Government procurement.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="54697">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
          <em>Establishing paid sick leave for Federal contractors and subcontractors.</em> (a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that new contracts, contract-like instruments, and solicitations (collectively referred to as &ldquo;contracts&rdquo;), as described in section 6 of this order, include a clause, which the contractor and any subcontractors shall incorporate into lower-tier subcontracts, specifying, as a condition of payment, that all employees, in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, shall earn not less than 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="54697">(b) A contractor may not set a limit on the total accrual of paid sick leave per year, or at any point in time, at less than 56 hours.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="54697">(c) Paid sick leave earned under this order may be used by an employee for an absence resulting from:</p>
        (i) physical or mental illness, injury, or medical condition;
        (ii) obtaining diagnosis, care, or preventive care from a health care provider;
        (iii) caring for a child, a parent, a spouse, a domestic partner, or any other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship who has any of the conditions or needs for diagnosis, care, or preventive care described in paragraphs (i) or (ii) of this subsection or is otherwise in need of care; or
        (iv) domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the time absent from work is for the purposes otherwise described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection, to obtain additional counseling, to seek relocation, to seek assistance from a victim services organization, to take related legal action, including preparation for or participation in any related civil or criminal legal proceeding, or to assist an individual related to the employee as described in paragraph (iii) of this subsection in engaging in any of these activities.

        <p id="p-10" data-page="54697">(d) Paid sick leave accrued under this order shall carry over from 1 year to the next and shall be reinstated for employees rehired by a covered contractor within 12 months after a job separation.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="54698"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-54698" data-page="54698" data-text="Start Printed Page 54698" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 54698}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 54698</span></span></span>
        </p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="54698">(e) The use of paid sick leave cannot be made contingent on the requesting employee finding a replacement to cover any work time to be missed.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="54698">(f) The paid sick leave required by this order is in addition to a contractor's obligations under 41 U.S.C. chapter 67 (Service Contract Act) and 40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV (Davis-Bacon Act), and contractors may not receive credit toward their prevailing wage or fringe benefit obligations under those Acts for any paid sick leave provided in satisfaction of the requirements of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="54698">(g) A contractor's existing paid leave policy provided in addition to the fulfillment of Service Contract Act or Davis-Bacon Act obligations, if applicable, and made available to all covered employees will satisfy the requirements of this order if the amount of paid leave is sufficient to meet the requirements of this section and if it may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions described herein.</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="54698">(h) Paid sick leave shall be provided upon the oral or written request of an employee that includes the expected duration of the leave, and is made at least 7 calendar days in advance where the need for the leave is foreseeable, and in other cases as soon as is practicable.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="54698">(i) Certification.</p>
        (i) A contractor may only require certification issued by a health care provider for paid sick leave used for the purposes listed in subsections (c)(i), (c)(ii), or (c)(iii) of this section for employee absences of 3 or more consecutive workdays, to be provided no later than 30 days from the first day of the leave.
        (ii) If 3 or more consecutive days of paid sick leave is used for the purposes listed in subsection (c)(iv) of this section, documentation may be required to be provided from an appropriate individual or organization with the minimum necessary information establishing a need for the employee to be absent from work. The contractor shall not disclose any verification information and shall maintain confidentiality about the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, unless the employee consents or when disclosure is required by law.
        <p id="p-18" data-page="54698">(j) Nothing in this order shall require a covered contractor to make a financial payment to an employee upon a separation from employment for accrued sick leave that has not been used, but unused leave is subject to reinstatement as prescribed in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="54698">(k) A covered contractor may not interfere with or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for taking, or attempting to take, paid sick leave as provided for under this order or in any manner asserting, or assisting any other employee in asserting, any right or claim related to this order.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="54698">(l) Nothing in this order shall excuse noncompliance with or supersede any applicable Federal or State law, any applicable law or municipal ordinance, or a collective bargaining agreement requiring greater paid sick leave or leave rights than those established under this order.</p>
