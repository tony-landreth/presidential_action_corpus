        <p id="p-82" data-page="18778"> &ldquo;(1) Nature of offense. Adultery is clearly unacceptable conduct, and it reflects adversely on the service record of the military member.</p>
        <p id="p-83" data-page="18778"> &ldquo;(2) Conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline or of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces. To constitute an offense under the UCMJ, the adulterous conduct must either be directly prejudicial to good order and discipline or service discrediting. Adulterous conduct that is directly prejudicial includes conduct that has an obvious, and measurably divisive effect on unit or organization discipline, morale, or cohesion, or is clearly detrimental to the authority or stature of or respect toward a servicemember. Adultery may also be service discrediting, even though the conduct is only indirectly or remotely prejudicial to good order and discipline. Discredit means to injure the reputation of the armed forces and includes adulterous conduct that has a tendency, because of its open or notorious nature, to bring the service into disrepute, make it subject to public ridicule, or lower it in public esteem. While adulterous conduct that is private and discreet in nature may not be service discrediting by this standard, under the circumstances, it may be determined to be conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. Commanders should consider all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to the following factors, when determining whether adulterous acts are prejudicial to good order and discipline or are of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces:</p>
        <p id="p-84" data-page="18778"> &ldquo;(a) The accused's marital status, military rank, grade, or position;</p>

        <p id="p-86" data-page="18778"> &ldquo;(c) The military status of the accused's spouse or the spouse of co-actor, or their relationship to the armed forces;</p>
        <p id="p-87" data-page="18778"> &ldquo;(d) The impact, if any, of the adulterous relationship on the ability of the accused, the co-actor, or the spouse of either to perform their duties in support of the armed forces;</p>
        <p id="p-88" data-page="18778"> &ldquo;(e) The misuse, if any, of government time and resources to facilitate the commission of the conduct;</p>
        <p id="p-89" data-page="18778"> &ldquo;(f) Whether the conduct persisted despite counseling or orders to desist; the flagrancy of the conduct, such as whether any notoriety ensued; and whether the adulterous act was accompanied by other violations of the UCMJ;</p>
        <p id="p-90" data-page="18778"> &ldquo;(g) The negative impact of the conduct on the units or organizations of the accused, the co-actor or the spouse of either of them, such as a detrimental effect on unit or organization morale, teamwork, and efficiency;</p>

        <p id="p-92" data-page="18778"> &ldquo;(i) Whether the adulterous misconduct involves an ongoing or recent relationship or is remote in time.</p>

        <p id="p-94" data-page="18779"> &ldquo;(4) Mistake of fact. A defense of mistake of fact exists if the accused had an honest and reasonable belief either that the accused and the co-actor were both unmarried, or that they were lawfully married to each other.

          <h1 id="h-2">CHANGES TO THE DISCUSSION ACCOMPANYING THE MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL, UNITED STATES</h1>
          <p id="p-104" data-page="18780">a. The Discussion following the Preamble is amended by adding the following at the end of the Discussion:</p>
          <p id="p-105" data-page="18780">&ldquo;The amendment to paragraph 4 of the Preamble is intended to address the possibility of more frequent amendments to the Manual and the arrival of the 21st century. In the event that multiple editions of the Manual are published in the same year, the numbering and lettering of the edition should match that of the most recent Executive Order included in the publication.&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-106" data-page="18780">b. The seventh paragraph of the Discussion following R.C.M. 601(e)(1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

          <p id="p-107" data-page="18780">&ldquo;The convening authority should acknowledge by an instruction that a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months, may not be adjudged when the prerequisites under Article 19 will not be met. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(B)(ii). For example, this instruction should be given when a court reporter is not detailed.&rdquo;.</p>
          <p id="p-108" data-page="18780">c. The Discussion following R.C.M. 701(a)(2)(B) is amended to read as follows:</p>

          <p id="p-109" data-page="18780">&ldquo;For specific rules concerning certain mental examinations of the accused or third party patients, <em>see</em> R.C.M. 701(f), R.C.M. 706, Mil. R. Evid. 302, and Mil. R. Evid. 513.&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-110" data-page="18780">d. The ninth paragraph of the Discussion following R.C.M. 806(b) is amended to read as follows:</p>

          <p id="p-111" data-page="18780">&ldquo;There are other methods of protecting the proceedings from harmful effects of publicity, including a thorough <em>voir dire</em> (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 912), and, if necessary, a continuance to allow the harmful effects of publicity to dissipate. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 906(b)(1). Other methods that may occasionally be appropriate and which are usually preferable to closing a session include: directing members not to read, listen to, or watch any accounts concerning the case; issuing a protective order under R.C.M. 806(d); and selecting members from recent arrivals in the command, or from outside the immediate area. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 503(a)(3). In more extreme cases, the place of trial may be changed (<em>see</em> R.C.M. 906(b)(11), or members may be sequestered.</p>
          <p id="p-112" data-page="18780">e. The following Discussion is added after R.C.M. 806(d): </p>
          <p id="p-113" data-page="18780">&ldquo;A protective order may proscribe extrajudicial statements by counsel, parties, and witnesses that might divulge prejudicial matter not of public record in the case. Other appropriate matters may also be addressed by such a protective order. Before issuing a protective order, the military judge must consider whether other available remedies would effectively mitigate the adverse effects that any publicity might create, and consider such an order's likely effectiveness in ensuring an impartial court-martial panel. A military judge should not issue a protective order without first providing notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard. The military judge must state on the record the reasons for issuing the protective order. If the reasons for issuing the order change, the military judge may reconsider the continued necessity for a protective order.&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-114" data-page="18780">f. The first paragraph of the Discussion following R.C.M. 808 is amended to read as follows:</p>

          <p id="p-115" data-page="18780">&ldquo;Except in a special court-martial not authorized to adjudge a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months, the trial counsel should ensure that a qualified court reporter is detailed to the court-martial. Trial counsel should also ensure that all exhibits and other documents relating to the case are properly maintained for later inclusion in the record. <em>See also</em> R.C.M. 1103(j) as to the use of videotapes, audiotapes, and similar recordings for the record of trial. Because of the potential requirement for a verbatim transcript, all proceedings, including sidebar conferences, arguments, and rulings and instructions by the military judge, should be recorded.&rdquo;<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="18781"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-18781" data-page="18781" data-text="Start Printed Page 18781" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 18781}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 18781</span></span></span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-116" data-page="18781">g. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1001(b)(3)(A) is amended by adding the following at the end of the Discussion: </p>
          <p id="p-117" data-page="18781">&ldquo;Whether a civilian conviction is admissible is left to the discretion of the military judge. As stated in the rule, a civilian &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; includes any disposition following an initial judicial determination or assumption of guilt regardless of the sentencing procedure and the final judgment following probation or other sentence. Therefore, convictions may be admissible regardless of whether a court ultimately suspended judgment upon discharge of the accused following probation, permitted withdrawal of the guilty plea, or applies some other form of alternative sentencing. Additionally, the term &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; need not be taken to mean a final judgment of conviction and sentence.&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-118" data-page="18781">h. The sixth paragraph of the Discussion following R.C.M. 1003(b)(2) is amended to read as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-119" data-page="18781">&ldquo;At a special court-martial, if a bad-conduct discharge and confinement are adjudged, then the operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds of pay only (not allowances) during that period of confinement. If only confinement is adjudged, and that confinement exceeds six months, then the operation of Article 58b results in a forfeiture of two-thirds of pay only (not allowances) during the period of confinement. If only a bad conduct discharge is adjudged, Article 58b has no effect on pay.&rdquo;.</p>
          <p id="p-120" data-page="18781">i. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1003(b)(3) is amended by adding at the end the following paragraph:</p>

          <p id="p-121" data-page="18781">&ldquo;Where the sentence adjudged at a special court-martial includes a fine, <em>see</em> R.C.M. 1107(d)(5) for limitations on convening authority action on the sentence.&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-122" data-page="18781">j. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1003(b)(8) is amended by adding the following at the end of the Discussion:</p>
          <p id="p-123" data-page="18781">&ldquo;See Article 56a.&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-124" data-page="18781">k. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1003(c)(4) is amended by striking &ldquo;R.C.M. 1107(d)(3)&rdquo; and inserting &ldquo;R.C.M. 1107(d)(4).&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-125" data-page="18781">l. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1006(c) is amended to read as follows: </p>
          <p id="p-126" data-page="18781">&ldquo;A proposal should state completely each kind and, where appropriate, amount of authorized punishment proposed by that member. For example, a proposal of confinement for life would state whether it is with or without eligibility for parole. See R.C.M. 1003(b).&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-127" data-page="18781">m. The second paragraph of the Discussion following R.C.M. 1107(d)(1) is amended to read as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-128" data-page="18781">&ldquo;When mitigating forfeitures, the duration and amounts of forfeiture may be changed as long as the total amount forfeited is not increased and neither the amount nor duration of the forfeitures exceeds the jurisdiction of the court-martial. When mitigating confinement or hard labor without confinement, the convening authority should use the equivalencies at R.C.M. 1003(b)(6) and (7), as appropriate. One form of punishment may be changed to a less severe punishment of a different nature, as long as the changed punishment is one that the court-martial could have adjudged. For example, a bad-conduct discharge adjudged by a special court-martial could be changed to confinement for up to one year (but not vice versa). A pretrial agreement may also affect what punishments may be changed by the convening authority.&rdquo;.</p>
          <p id="p-129" data-page="18781">n. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1109(f) is amended to read as follows:</p>

          <p id="p-130" data-page="18781">&ldquo;An officer exercising special court-martial jurisdiction may vacate any suspended punishments other than an approved suspended bad-conduct discharge or any suspended portion of an approved sentence to confinement for one year, regardless of whether they are contained in the same sentence as the bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year. See Appendix 18 for a sample of a Report of Proceedings to Vacate Suspension of a Special Court-Martial Sentence including a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year under Article 72, UCMJ, and R.C.M. 1109 (DD Form 455).&rdquo;.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="18782"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-18782" data-page="18782" data-text="Start Printed Page 18782" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 18782}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 18782</span></span></span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-131" data-page="18782">o. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1110(a) is amended to read as follows:</p>

          <p id="p-132" data-page="18782">&ldquo;Appellate review is not available for special courts-martial in which a bad-conduct discharge or confinement for one year was not adjudged or approved or for summary courts-martial. Cases not subject to appellate review, or in which appellate review is waived or withdrawn, are reviewed by a judge advocate under R.C.M. 1112. Such cases may also be submitted to the Judge Advocate General for review. <em>See</em> R.C.M. 1201(b)(3). Appellate review is mandatory when the approved sentence includes death.&rdquo;. </p>

          <p id="p-167" data-page="18783">&ldquo;<em>2002 Amendment</em>: Subsections (f)(2)(B)(i) and (f)(2)(B)(ii) were amended to remove previous limitations and thereby implement the amendment to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 819 (Article 19, UCMJ) contained in section 577 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, P.

          <p id="p-170" data-page="18783">c. The Analysis to R.C.M. 707(a) is amended by inserting after the second paragraph the following new paragraph:</p>
          <p id="p-171" data-page="18783">&ldquo;<em>2002 Amendment</em>: <em>Burton</em> and its progeny were re-examined in <em>United States v.

Tibbs</em>, 15 C.M.A. 350, 353, 35 C.M.R. 322, 325 (1965). <em>See Kossman</em>, 38 M.J. at 262. In <em>Kossman</em>, the Court reinstated the &ldquo;reasonable diligence&rdquo; standard in determining whether the prosecution's progress toward trial for a confined accused was sufficient to satisfy the speedy trial requirement of Article 10, UCMJ.&rdquo;</p>
          <p id="p-172" data-page="18783">d. The Analysis accompanying R.C.M. 806 is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:</p>
          <p id="p-173" data-page="18783">&ldquo;<em>2002 Amendment</em>: Section (d) was added to codify the military judge's power to issue orders limiting trial participants' extrajudicial statements in appropriate cases. <em>See United States v. Garwood</em>, 16 M.J. 863, 868 (N-M.C.M.R. 1983) (finding military judge was justified in issuing restrictive order prohibiting extrajudicial statements by trial participants), <em>aff'd on other grounds</em>, 20 M.J. 148 (C.M.A. 1985), <em>cert. denied</em>, 474 U.S. 1005 (1985); <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="18784"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-18784" data-page="18784" data-text="Start Printed Page 18784" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 18784}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 18784</span></span></span>
            <em>United States v. Clark</em>, 31 M.J. 721, 724 (A.F.C.M.R. 1990) (suggesting, but not deciding, that the military judge properly limited trial participants' extrajudicial statements).</p>
          <p id="p-174" data-page="18784">&ldquo;The public has a legitimate interest in the conduct of military justice proceedings. Informing the public about the operations of the criminal justice system is one of the &ldquo;core purposes&rdquo; of the First Amendment. In the appropriate case where the military judge is considering issuing a protective order, absent exigent circumstances, the military judge must conduct a hearing prior to issuing such an order. Prior to such a hearing the parties will have been provided notice. At the hearing, all parties will be provided an opportunity to be heard. The opportunity to be heard may be extended to representatives of the media in the appropriate case.</p>

          <p id="p-175" data-page="18784">&ldquo;Section (d) is based on the first Recommendation Relating to the Conduct of Judicial Proceedings in Criminal Cases, included in the Revised Report of the Judicial Conference Committee on the Operation of the Jury System on the &ldquo;Free Press&mdash;Fair Trial&rdquo; Issue, 87 F.R.D. 519, 529 (1980), which was approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States on September 25, 1980. The requirement that the protective order be issued in writing is based on Rule for Courts-Martial 405(g)(6). Section (d) adopts a &ldquo;substantial likelihood of material prejudice&rdquo; standard in place of the Judicial Conference recommendation of a &ldquo;likely to interfere&rdquo; standard. The Judicial Conference's recommendation was issued before the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Gentile v. State Bar of Nev.</em>, 501 U.S. 1030 (1991). <em>Gentile</em>, which dealt with a Rule of Professional Conduct governing extrajudicial statements, indicates that a lawyer may be disciplined for making statements that present a substantial likelihood of material prejudice to an accused's right to a fair trial. While the use of protective orders is distinguishable from limitations imposed by a bar's ethics rule, the <em>Gentile</em> decision expressly recognized that the &ldquo;speech of lawyers representing clients in pending cases may be regulated under a less demanding standard than that established for regulation of the press in <em>Nebraska Press Ass'n v. Stuart</em>, 427 U.S. 539 (1976), and the cases which preceded it.&rdquo; 501 U.S. at 1074. The Court concluded that &ldquo;the `substantial likelihood of material prejudice' standard constitutes a constitutionally permissible balance between the First Amendment rights of attorneys in pending cases and the State's interest in fair trials.&rdquo; <em>Id.</em> at 1075. <em>Gentile</em> also supports the constitutionality of restricting communications of non-lawyer participants in a court case. <em>Id.</em> at 1072-73 (citing <em>Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart</em>, 467 U.S. 20, 32-33 (1984)). Accordingly, a protective order issued under the &ldquo;substantial likelihood of material prejudice&rdquo; standard is constitutionally permissible.</p>

          <p id="p-176" data-page="18784">&ldquo;The first sentence of the discussion is based on the committee comment to the Recommendations Relating to the Conduct of Judicial Proceedings in Criminal Cases. <em>See</em> 87 F.R.D. at 530. For a definition of &ldquo;party,&rdquo; <em>see</em> R.C.M. 103(16). The second sentence of the discussion is based on the first of the Judicial Conference's recommendations concerning special orders. <em>See</em> 87 F.R.D. at 529. The third sentence of the discussion is based on the second of the Judicial Conference's recommendations, <em>id.</em> at 532, and on <em>United States v. Salameh</em>, 992 F.2d 445, 447 (2d Cir. 1993) (<em>per curiam</em>), and <em>In re Application of Dow Jones &amp; Co.</em>, 842 F.2d 603, 611 &amp; n.1 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 488 U.S. 946 (1988). The fourth sentence is based on <em>Salameh</em>, 992 F.2d at 447. The fifth sentence is based on Rule for Courts-Martial 905(d).&rdquo;.</p>
          <p id="p-177" data-page="18784">e. The Analysis accompanying R.C.M. 1001(b)(3)(A) is amended by inserting the following at the end thereof:</p>
          <p id="p-178" data-page="18784">&ldquo;<em>2002 Amendment</em>: As previously written, R.C.M. 1001(b)(3)(A) offered little guidance about what it meant by &ldquo;civilian convictions.&rdquo; <em>See, e.g., United States v. White</em>, 47 M.J. 139, 140 (C.A.A.F. 1997); <em>United States v. Barnes</em>, 33 M.J. 468, 472-73 (C.M.A. 1992); <em>United States v. Slovacek</em>, 24 M.J. 140, 141 (CMA), <em>cert. denied</em>, 484 U.S. 855 (1987). The present rule addresses this void and intends to give the sentencing authority as <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="18785"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-18785" data-page="18785" data-text="Start Printed Page 18785" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 18785}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 18785</span></span></span>much information as the military judge determines is relevant in order to craft an appropriate sentence for the accused.</p>
          <p id="p-179" data-page="18785">&ldquo;Unlike most civilian courts, this rule does not allow admission of more extensive criminal history information, such as arrests. Use of such additional information is not appropriate in the military setting where court-martial members, not a military judge, often decide the sentence. Such information risks unnecessarily confusing the members.</p>

          <p id="p-180" data-page="18785">&ldquo;The present rule clarifies the term &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; in light of the complex and varying ways civilian jurisdictions treat the subject. The military judge may admit relevant evidence of civilian convictions without necessarily being bound by the action, procedure, or nomenclature of civilian jurisdictions. Examples of judicial determinations admissible as convictions under this rule include accepted pleas of <em>nolo contendere</em>, pleas accepted under <em>North Carolina v. Alford</em>, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), or deferred sentences. If relevant, evidence of forfeiture of bail that results in a judicial determination of guilt is also admissible, as recognized in <em>United States v. Eady</em>, 35 M.J. 15, 16 (C.M.A. 1992). While no time limit is placed upon the admissibility of prior convictions, the military judge should conduct a balancing test to determine whether convictions older than ten years should be admitted or excluded on the basis of relevance and fundamental fairness.</p>

          <p id="p-181" data-page="18785">&ldquo;The two central factors in this rule are (1) judicial determination of guilt and (2) assumption of guilt. Assumption of guilt is an all-inclusive term meaning any act by the accused in a judicial proceeding accepting, acknowledging, or admitting guilt. As long as either factor is present, the &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; is admissible, if relevant. Consequently, this rule departs from the holding in <em>United States v. Hughes</em>, 26 M.J. 119, 120 (C.M.A. 1988), where the accused pleaded guilty in a Texas court, but the judge did not enter a finding of guilty under state law allowing &ldquo;deferred adjudications.&rdquo; Under the present rule, the &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; would be admissible because the accused pleaded guilty in a judicial proceeding, notwithstanding the fact that the state judge did not enter a finding of guilty.</p>

          <p id="p-182" data-page="18785">&ldquo;In contrast, &ldquo;deferred prosecutions,&rdquo; where there is neither an admission of guilt in a judicial proceeding nor a finding of guilty, would be excluded. The rule also excludes expunged convictions, juvenile adjudications, minor traffic violations, foreign convictions, and tribal court convictions as matters inappropriate for or unnecessarily confusing to courts-martial members. What constitutes a &ldquo;minor traffic violation&rdquo; within the meaning of this rule is to be decided with reference only to federal law, and not to the laws of individual states. <em>See</em> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &sect; 4A1.2(c)(2); &ldquo;What Constitutes `Minor Traffic Infraction' Excludable From Calculation of Defendant's Criminal History under United States Sentencing Guideline &sect; 4A1.2(c)(2),&rdquo; 113 A.L.R. Fed. 561 (1993).</p>

          <p id="p-183" data-page="18785">&ldquo;Additionally, because of the lack of clarity in the previous rule, courts sometimes turned to Mil. R. Evid. 609 for guidance. <em>See, e.g., Slovacek</em>, 24 M.J. at 141. We note that because the policies behind Mil. R. Evid. 609 and the present rule differ greatly, a conviction that may not be appropriate for impeachment purposes under Mil. R. Evid. 609, may nevertheless be admissible under the present rule.</p>
          <p id="p-184" data-page="18785">&ldquo;The Federal Sentencing Guidelines were consulted when drafting the present rule. Although informed by those guidelines, the present rule departs from them in many respects because of the wide differences between the courts-martial process and practice in federal district court.&rdquo;.</p>
          <p id="p-185" data-page="18785">f. The Analysis to R.C.M. 1003(b)(3) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:</p>

Solis</em>, 46 M.J. 31, 35 (C.A.A.F. 1997). In Solis, the court said subparagraph c(6) could be viewed as serving at least three different purposes. It could be (1) an expansive description of dicta with no intent to limit prosecutions; (2) protection for an accused against overcharging; or (3) guidance for the conduct of investigations. Subparagraph c(6) was never intended to establish either procedural rights for an accused or internal guidelines to regulate government conduct. Subparagraph (c)(6) was based upon <em>United States v. Aronson</em>, 8 U.S.C.M.A. 525, 25 C.M.R. 29 (1957); <em>United States v. Washington</em>, 9 U.S.C.M.A. 131, 25 C.M.R. 393 (1958) and <em>United States v. Davenport</em>, 9 M.J. 364 (C.M.A. 1980) and was intended merely to describe the rule developed in those cases that a false statement to a law enforcement agent, when made by a servicemember without an independent duty to speak, was not 'official' and therefore not within the purview of Article 107. The subparagraph is removed because the position of the Court of Military Appeals in the three decisions noted above was abandoned in <em>United States v.
