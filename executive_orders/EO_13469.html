        <p id="p-2" data-page="43841">I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the continued actions and policies of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions, manifested most recently in the fundamentally undemocratic election held on June 27, 2008, to commit acts of violence and other human rights abuses against political opponents, and to engage in public corruption, including by misusing public authority, constitute an unusual and extraor- dinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States, and to deal with that threat, hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13288">Executive Order 13288</a> of March 6, 2003, and relied upon for additional steps taken in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13391">Executive Order 13391</a> of November 22, 2005, and hereby order:</p>

        (vii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in support of, the Government of Zimbabwe, any senior official thereof, or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13288">Executive Order 13288,</a> <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13391">Executive Order 13391,</a> or this order; or (viii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="43842"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-43842" data-page="43842" data-text="Start Printed Page 43842" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 43842}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 43842</span></span></span>of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13288">Executive Order 13288,</a> <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13391">Executive Order 13391,</a> or this order.
        <p id="p-12" data-page="43842">(b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13288">Executive Order 13288,</a> as amended, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="43842">(c) The prohibitions of this section include but are not limited to (i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13288">Executive Order 13288,</a> <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13391">Executive Order 13391,</a> or this order, and (ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="43842">(d) The provisions of Executive Orders 13288 and 13391 remain in effect, and this order does not affect any action taken pursuant to those orders.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="43842">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="43842">(b)Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="43842">
          <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> For the purposes of this order:</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="43842">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="43842">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>

          <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that, for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13288">Executive Order 13288,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law.
