          <h1 id="h-1">Periodic Review of Individuals Detained at Guant&aacute;namo Bay Naval Station Pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="13277">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of Military Force of September 2001 (AUMF), <a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=107&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=40&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 107-40</a>, and in order to ensure that military detention of individuals now held at the U.S. Naval Station, Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba (Guant&aacute;namo), who were subject to the interagency review under section 4 of <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13492">Executive Order 13492</a> of January 22, 2009, continues to be carefully evaluated and justified, consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice, I hereby order as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="13277">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em>Scope and Purpose. </em> (a) The periodic review described in section 3 of this order applies only to those detainees held at Guant&aacute;namo on the date of this order, whom the interagency review established by <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13492">Executive Order 13492</a> has (i) designated for continued law of war detention; or (ii) referred for prosecution, except for those detainees against whom charges are pending or a judgment of conviction has been entered.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="13277">(b) This order is intended solely to establish, as a discretionary matter, a process to review on a periodic basis the executive branch's continued, discretionary exercise of existing detention authority in individual cases. It does not create any additional or separate source of detention authority, and it does not affect the scope of detention authority under existing law. Detainees at Guant&aacute;namo have the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and nothing in this order is intended to affect the jurisdiction of Federal courts to determine the legality of their detention.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="13277">(c) In the event detainees covered by this order are transferred from Guant&aacute;namo to another U.S. detention facility where they remain in law of war detention, this order shall continue to apply to them.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="13277">
            <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
            <em>Standard for Continued Detention. </em> Continued law of war detention is warranted for a detainee subject to the periodic review in section 3 of this order if it is necessary to protect against a significant threat to the security of the United States.</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="13277">
            <strong>Sec. 3.</strong>
            <em>Periodic Review. </em> The Secretary of Defense shall coordinate a process of periodic review of continued law of war detention for each detainee described in section 1(a) of this order. In consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense shall issue implementing guidelines governing the process, consistent with the following requirements:</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="13277">(a) <em>Initial Review. </em> For each detainee, an initial review shall commence as soon as possible but no later than 1 year from the date of this order. The initial review will consist of a hearing before a Periodic Review Board (PRB). The review and hearing shall follow a process that includes the following requirements:</p>

          (1) Each detainee shall be provided, in writing and in a language the detainee understands, with advance notice of the PRB review and an unclassified summary of the factors and information the PRB will consider in evaluating whether the detainee meets the standard set forth in section 2 of this order. The written summary shall be sufficiently comprehensive to provide adequate notice to the detainee of the reasons for continued detention.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="13278"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-13278" data-page="13278" data-text="Start Printed Page 13278" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 13278}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 13278</span></span></span>
          
          (2) The detainee shall be assisted in proceedings before the PRB by a Government-provided personal representative (representative) who possesses the security clearances necessary for access to the information described in subsection (a)(4) of this section. The representative shall advocate on behalf of the detainee before the PRB and shall be responsible for challenging the Government's information and introducing information on behalf of the detainee. In addition to the representative, the detainee may be assisted in proceedings before the PRB by private counsel, at no expense to the Government.
          (3) The detainee shall be permitted to (i) present to the PRB a written or oral statement; (ii) introduce relevant information, including written declarations; (iii) answer any questions posed by the PRB; and (iv) call witnesses who are reasonably available and willing to provide information that is relevant and material to the standard set forth in section 2 of this order.
          (4) The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant Government agencies, shall compile and provide to the PRB all information in the detainee disposition recommendations produced by the Task Force established under <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13492">Executive Order 13492</a> that is relevant to the determination whether the standard in section 2 of this order has been met and on which the Government seeks to rely for that determination. In addition, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant Government agencies, shall compile any additional information relevant to that determination, and on which the Government seeks to rely for that determination, that has become available since the conclusion of the <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13492">Executive Order 13492</a> review. All mitigating information relevant to that determination must be provided to the PRB.
          (5) The information provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be provided to the detainee's representative. In exceptional circumstances where it is necessary to protect national security, including intelligence sources and methods, the PRB may determine that the representative must receive a sufficient substitute or summary, rather than the underlying information. If the detainee is represented by private counsel, the information provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be provided to such counsel unless the Government determines that the need to protect national security, including intelligence sources and methods, or law enforcement or privilege concerns, requires the Government to provide counsel with a sufficient substitute or summary of the information. A sufficient substitute or summary must provide a meaningful opportunity to assist the detainee during the review process.
          (6) The PRB shall conduct a hearing to consider the information described in subsection (a)(4) of this section, and other relevant information provided by the detainee or the detainee's representative or counsel, to determine whether the standard in section 2 of this order is met. The PRB shall consider the reliability of any information provided to it in making its determination.
          (7) The PRB shall make a prompt determination, by consensus and in writing, as to whether the detainee's continued detention is warranted under the standard in section 2 of this order. If the PRB determines that the standard is not met, the PRB shall also recommend any conditions that relate to the detainee's transfer. The PRB shall provide a written summary of any final determination in unclassified form to the detainee, in a language the detainee understands, within 30 days of the determination when practicable.

          (8) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a secretariat to administer the PRB review and hearing process. The Director of National Intelligence shall assist in preparing the unclassified notice and the substitutes or summaries described above. Other executive departments and agencies shall assist in the process of providing the PRB with information required for the review processes detailed in this order.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="13279"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-13279" data-page="13279" data-text="Start Printed Page 13279" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 13279}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 13279</span></span></span>
          
          <p id="p-16" data-page="13279">(b) <em>Subsequent Full Review. </em> The continued detention of each detainee shall be subject to subsequent full reviews and hearings by the PRB on a triennial basis. Each subsequent review shall employ the procedures set forth in section 3(a) of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-17" data-page="13279">(c) <em>File Reviews. </em> The continued detention of each detainee shall also be subject to a file review every 6 months in the intervening years between full reviews. This file review will be conducted by the PRB and shall consist of a review of any relevant new information related to the detainee compiled by the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant agencies, since the last review and, as appropriate, information considered during any prior PRB review. The detainee shall be permitted to make a written submission in connection with each file review. If, during the file review, a significant question is raised as to whether the detainee's continued detention is warranted under the standard in section 2 of this order, the PRB will promptly convene a full review pursuant to the standards in section 3(a) of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="13279">(d) <em>Review of PRB Determinations. </em> The Review Committee (Committee), as defined in section 9(d) of this order, shall conduct a review if (i) a member of the Committee seeks review of a PRB determination within 30 days of that determination; or (ii) consensus within the PRB cannot be reached.</p>

          <p id="p-20" data-page="13279">(b) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall be responsible for obtaining appropriate security and humane treatment assurances regarding any detainee to be transferred to another country, and for determining, after consultation with members of the Committee, that it is appropriate to proceed with the transfer.</p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="13279">(c) The Secretary of State shall evaluate humane treatment assurances in all cases, consistent with the recommendations of the Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies established by <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13491">Executive Order 13491</a> of January 22, 2009.</p>
