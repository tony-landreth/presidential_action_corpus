        <h1 id="h-1">Using Behavioral Science Insights To Better Serve the American People</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="56365">A growing body of evidence demonstrates that behavioral science insights&mdash;research findings from fields such as behavioral economics and psychology about how people make decisions and act on them&mdash;can be used to design government policies to better serve the American people.</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="56365">Where Federal policies have been designed to reflect behavioral science insights, they have substantially improved outcomes for the individuals, families, communities, and businesses those policies serve. For example, automatic enrollment and automatic escalation in retirement savings plans have made it easier to save for the future, and have helped Americans accumulate billions of dollars in additional retirement savings. Similarly, streamlining the application process for Federal financial aid has made college more financially accessible for millions of students.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="56365">To more fully realize the benefits of behavioral insights and deliver better results at a lower cost for the American people, the Federal Government should design its policies and programs to reflect our best understanding of how people engage with, participate in, use, and respond to those policies and programs. By improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Government, behavioral science insights can support a range of national priorities, including helping workers to find better jobs; enabling Americans to lead longer, healthier lives; improving access to educational opportunities and support for success in school; and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="56365">NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I hereby direct the following:</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="56365">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Behavioral Science Insights Policy Directive.</em>
        </p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="56365">(a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) are encouraged to:</p>
        (i) identify policies, programs, and operations where applying behavioral science insights may yield substantial improvements in public welfare, program outcomes, and program cost effectiveness;
        (ii) develop strategies for applying behavioral science insights to programs and, where possible, rigorously test and evaluate the impact of these insights;
        (iii) recruit behavioral science experts to join the Federal Government as necessary to achieve the goals of this directive; and
        (iv) strengthen agency relationships with the research community to better use empirical findings from the behavioral sciences.
        <p id="p-11" data-page="56365">(b) In implementing the policy directives in section (a), agencies shall:</p>
        (i) identify opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, communities, and businesses access public programs and benefits by, as appropriate, streamlining processes that may otherwise limit or delay participation&mdash;for example, removing administrative hurdles, shortening wait times, and simplifying forms;

        (ii) improve how information is presented to consumers, borrowers, program beneficiaries, and other individuals, whether as directly conveyed by the agency, or in setting standards for the presentation of information, by considering how the content, format, timing, and medium by which <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="56366"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-56366" data-page="56366" data-text="Start Printed Page 56366" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 56366}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 56366</span></span></span>information is conveyed affects comprehension and action by individuals, as appropriate;
        (iii) identify programs that offer choices and carefully consider how the presentation and structure of those choices, including the order, number, and arrangement of options, can most effectively promote public welfare, as appropriate, giving particular consideration to the selection and setting of default options; and
        (iv) review elements of their policies and programs that are designed to encourage or make it easier for Americans to take specific actions, such as saving for retirement or completing education programs. In doing so, agencies shall consider how the timing, frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, taxes, subsidies, and other incentives can more effectively and efficiently promote those actions, as appropriate. Particular attention should be paid to opportunities to use nonfinancial incentives.
        <p id="p-16" data-page="56366">(c) For policies with a regulatory component, agencies are encouraged to combine this behavioral science insights policy directive with their ongoing review of existing significant regulations to identify and reduce regulatory burdens, as appropriate and consistent with <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13563">Executive Order 13563</a> of January 18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), and <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13610">Executive Order 13610</a> of May 10, 2012 (Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burdens).</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="56366">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Implementation of the Behavioral Science Insights Policy Directive.</em> (a) The Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST), under the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and chaired by the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, shall provide agencies with advice and policy guidance to help them execute the policy objectives outlined in section 1 of this order, as appropriate.</p>
        <p id="p-18" data-page="56366">(b) The NSTC shall release a yearly report summarizing agency implementation of section 1 of this order each year until 2019. Member agencies of the SBST are expected to contribute to this report.</p>
        <p id="p-19" data-page="56366">(c) To help execute the policy directive set forth in section 1 of this order, the Chair of the SBST shall, within 45 days of the date of this order and thereafter as necessary, issue guidance to assist agencies in implementing this order.</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="56366">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. <em>General Provisions.</em> (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
