        <HD SOURCE="HED">Federal Interagency Task Force on the District of Columbia</HD>
        <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to further the revitalization of, and to improve prospects for the success of “home rule” in the District of Columbia, the Nation's Capital, it is hereby ordered as follows:</FP>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Section 1.</E>
          <E T="03"> Background and Policy.</E> The District of Columbia is the Nation's Capital, and the Federal Government is the largest employer, landholder, and purchaser in the region. The Executive Office of the President has established and maintained an interest in fostering the Federal relationship with the District of Columbia since 1963. This Administration has long sought to strengthen the relationship between the Federal Government and the District of Columbia by initiating a historic restructuring of this relationship. At the request of the President, in 1995, the Federal D.C. Interagency Task Force, chaired by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and directed by the Special Advisor to the President and Executive Director of the Federal D.C. Interagency Task Force, was created to revitalize the District of Columbia and improve prospects for “home rule” to succeed in the Nation's Capital. The Federal D.C. Interagency Task Force Office has worked with Federal agencies, the Congress, and local officials to promote long-term financial stability, economic growth, and opportunity for self-government for the District of Columbia. In 1997, the President signed into law the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997, under which the Federal Government undertook certain responsibilities and governmental functions befitting a State or county government. Also in 1997, the President signed into law tax incentives designed to spur economic growth in the District of Columbia.</FP>
        <FP>It is the policy of this Administration, therefore, to build on the momentum of the accomplishments over the last 5 years by formally establishing the Federal D.C. Interagency Task Force to further assist the District of Columbia in achieving financial stability, economic growth, and improvement in management and service delivery.</FP>
