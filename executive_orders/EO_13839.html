        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13839">Executive Order 13839</a> of May 25, 2018
        <h1 id="h-1">Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent With Merit System Principles</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="25343">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 1104(a)(1), 3301, and 7301 of title 5, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to ensure the effective functioning of the executive branch, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="25343">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em>Purpose</em>. Merit system principles call for holding Federal employees accountable for performance and conduct. They state that employees should maintain high standards of integrity, conduct, and concern for the public interest, and that the Federal workforce should be used efficiently and effectively. They further state that employees should be retained based on the adequacy of their performance, inadequate performance should be corrected, and employees should be separated who cannot or will not improve their performance to meet required standards. Unfortunately, implementation of America's civil service laws has fallen far short of these ideals. The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey has consistently found that less than one-third of Federal employees believe that the Government deals with poor performers effectively. Failure to address unacceptable performance and misconduct undermines morale, burdens good performers with subpar colleagues, and inhibits the ability of executive agencies (as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, but excluding the Government Accountability Office) (agencies) to accomplish their missions. This order advances the ability of supervisors in agencies to promote civil servant accountability consistent with merit system principles while simultaneously recognizing employees' procedural rights and protections.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="25343">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Principles for Accountability in the Federal Workforce</em>. (a) Removing unacceptable performers should be a straightforward process that minimizes the burden on supervisors. Agencies should limit opportunity periods to demonstrate acceptable performance under section 4302(c)(6) of title 5, United States Code, to the amount of time that provides sufficient opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="25343">(b) Supervisors and deciding officials should not be required to use progressive discipline. The penalty for an instance of misconduct should be tailored to the facts and circumstances.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="25343">(c) Each employee's work performance and disciplinary history is unique, and disciplinary action should be calibrated to the specific facts and circumstances of each individual employee's situation. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time -- particularly where the employees are in different work units or chains of supervision -- and agencies are not prohibited from removing an employee simply because they did not remove a different employee for comparable conduct. Nonetheless, employees should be treated equitably, so agencies should consider appropriate comparators as they evaluate potential disciplinary actions.</p>

        <p id="p-6" data-page="25343">(d) Suspension should not be a substitute for removal in circumstances in which removal would be appropriate. Agencies should not require suspension of an employee before proposing to remove that employee, except as may be appropriate under applicable facts.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="25344"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-25344" data-page="25344" data-text="Start Printed Page 25344" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 25344}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 25344</span></span></span>
        </p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="25344">(e) When taking disciplinary action, agencies should have discretion to take into account an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all past misconduct -- not only similar past misconduct. Agencies should provide an employee with appropriate notice when taking a disciplinary action.</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="25344">(f) To the extent practicable, agencies should issue decisions on proposed removals taken under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, within 15 business days of the end of the employee reply period following a notice of proposed removal.</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="25344">(g) To the extent practicable, agencies should limit the written notice of adverse action to the 30 days prescribed in section 7513(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="25344">(h) The removal procedures set forth in chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code (Chapter 75 procedures), should be used in appropriate cases to address instances of unacceptable performance.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="25344">(i) A probationary period should be used as the final step in the hiring process of a new employee. Supervisors should use that period to assess how well an employee can perform the duties of a job. A probationary period can be a highly effective tool to evaluate a candidate's potential to be an asset to an agency before the candidate's appointment becomes final.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="25344">(j) Following issuance of regulations under section 7 of this order, agencies should prioritize performance over length of service when determining which employees will be retained following a reduction in force.</p>
        <p id="p-13" data-page="25344">
          <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. <em>Standard for Negotiating Grievance Procedures</em>. Whenever reasonable in view of the particular circumstances, agency heads shall endeavor to exclude from the application of any grievance procedures negotiated under section 7121 of title 5, United States Code, any dispute concerning decisions to remove any employee from Federal service for misconduct or unacceptable performance. Each agency shall commit the time and resources necessary to achieve this goal and to fulfill its obligation to bargain in good faith. If an agreement cannot be reached, the agency shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly request the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and, as necessary, the Federal Service Impasses Panel in the resolution of the disagreement. Within 30 days after the adoption of any collective bargaining agreement that fails to achieve this goal, the agency head shall provide an explanation to the President, through the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM Director).</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="25344">
          <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. <em>Managing the Federal Workforce</em>.

        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-19" data-page="25344">(i) that limits the agency's discretion to employ Chapter 75 procedures to address unacceptable performance of an employee;</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-20" data-page="25344">(ii) that requires the use of procedures under chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code (including any performance assistance period or similar informal period to demonstrate improved performance prior to the initiation of an opportunity period under section 4302(c)(6) of title 5, United States Code), before removing an employee for unacceptable performance; or</p>

        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-21" data-page="25344">(iii) that limits the agency's discretion to remove an employee from Federal service without first engaging in progressive discipline; or<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="25345"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-25345" data-page="25345" data-text="Start Printed Page 25345" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 25345}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 25345</span></span></span>

          <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. <em>Ensuring Integrity of Personnel Files</em>.
