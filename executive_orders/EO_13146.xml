          <E T="03"> Policy. </E>Princeville, North Carolina (Princeville) has a unique place in American history. This small city in eastern North Carolina was the first city in the United States founded by ex-slaves. In its history, Princeville has been damaged by floods many times. Recently, it was devastated by floods caused by Hurricane Floyd. In response to the damage, appropriate Federal agencies have already begun repair and recovery efforts to assist Princeville. However, it is the policy of this Administration to do more to help this city that occupies such a significant place in our history. Therefore, this order will create an interagency council to develop recommendations for further actions to address the future of Princeville.</FP>
