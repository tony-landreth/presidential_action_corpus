          <h1 id="h-1">Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors</h1>

          <p id="p-1" data-page="9851">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=40&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=101&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">40 U.S.C. 101</a> <em>et seq.,</em> and in order to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by contracting with sources who adequately compensate their workers, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="9851">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> This order seeks to increase efficiency and cost savings in the work performed by parties who contract with the Federal Government by increasing to $10.10 the hourly minimum wage paid by those contractors. Raising the pay of low-wage workers increases their morale and the productivity and quality of their work, lowers turnover and its accompanying costs, and reduces supervisory costs. These savings and quality improvements will lead to improved economy and efficiency in Government procurement.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="9851">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Establishing a minimum wage for Federal contractors and subcontractors.</em> (a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that new contracts, contract-like instruments, and solicitations (collectively referred to as &ldquo;contracts&rdquo;), as described in section 7 of this order, include a clause, which the contractor and any subcontractors shall incorporate into lower-tier subcontracts, specifying, as a condition of payment, that the minimum wage to be paid to workers, including workers whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=29&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=214&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">29 U.S.C. 214</a>(c), in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, shall be at least:</p>
          (i) $10.10 per hour beginning January 1, 2015; and
          (ii) beginning January 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary). The amount shall be published by the Secretary at least 90 days before such new minimum wage is to take effect and shall be:
          <p id="p-6" data-page="9851">(A) not less than the amount in effect on the date of such determination;</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="9851">(B) increased from such amount by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (United States city average, all items, not seasonally adjusted), or its successor publication, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="9851">(C) rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05.</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="9851">(b) In calculating the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for purposes of subsection (a)(ii)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall compare such Consumer Price Index for the most recent month, quarter, or year available (as selected by the Secretary prior to the first year for which a minimum wage is in effect pursuant to subsection (a)(ii)(B)) with the Consumer Price Index for the same month in the preceding year, the same quarter in the preceding year, or the preceding year, respectively.</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="9851">(c) Nothing in this order shall excuse noncompliance with any applicable Federal or State prevailing wage law, or any applicable law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under this order.</p>
