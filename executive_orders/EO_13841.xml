        <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13841 of June 20, 2018</EXECORDR>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">Affording Congress an Opportunity To Address Family Separation</HD>

        <P>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> it is hereby ordered as follows:</P>
        <FP>
          <E T="04">Section 1</E>. <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration laws. Under our laws, the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is at a designated port of entry at an appropriate time. When an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else, that alien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment under section 1325(a) of title 8, United States Code. This Administration will initiate proceedings to enforce this and other criminal provisions of the INA until and unless Congress directs otherwise. It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources. It is unfortunate that Congress's failure to act and court orders have put the Administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law.</FP>
        <FP>

        <P>(e) The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in <E T="03">Flores v. Sessions,</E> CV 85-4544 (“<E T="03">Flores</E> settlement”), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.</P>
