          <h1 id="h-1">Combating Wildlife Trafficking</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="40621">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to address the significant effects of wildlife trafficking on the national interests of the United States, I hereby order as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="40621">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> The poaching of protected species and the illegal trade in wildlife and their derivative parts and products (together known as &ldquo;wildlife trafficking&rdquo;) represent an international crisis that continues to escalate. Poaching operations have expanded beyond small-scale, opportunistic actions to coordinated slaughter commissioned by armed and organized criminal syndicates. The survival of protected wildlife species such as elephants, rhinos, great apes, tigers, sharks, tuna, and turtles has beneficial economic, social, and environmental impacts that are important to all nations. Wildlife trafficking reduces those benefits while generating billions of dollars in illicit revenues each year, contributing to the illegal economy, fueling instability, and undermining security. Also, the prevention of trafficking of live animals helps us control the spread of emerging infectious diseases. For these reasons, it is in the national interest of the United States to combat wildlife trafficking.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="40621">In order to enhance domestic efforts to combat wildlife trafficking, to assist foreign nations in building capacity to combat wildlife trafficking, and to assist in combating transnational organized crime, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take all appropriate actions within their authority, including the promulgation of rules and regulations and the provision of technical and financial assistance, to combat wildlife trafficking in accordance with the following objectives:</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="40621">(a) in appropriate cases, the United States shall seek to assist those governments in anti-wildlife trafficking activities when requested by foreign nations experiencing trafficking of protected wildlife;</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="40621">(b) the United States shall promote and encourage the development and enforcement by foreign nations of effective laws to prohibit the illegal taking of, and trade in, these species and to prosecute those who engage in wildlife trafficking, including by building capacity;</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="40621">(c) in concert with the international community and partner organizations, the United States shall seek to combat wildlife trafficking; and</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="40621">(d) the United States shall seek to reduce the demand for illegally traded wildlife, both at home and abroad, while allowing legal and legitimate commerce involving wildlife.</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="40621">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Establishment.</em> There is established a Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking (Task Force), to be co-chaired by the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Interior, and the Attorney General (Co-Chairs), or their designees, who shall report to the President through the National Security Advisor.
