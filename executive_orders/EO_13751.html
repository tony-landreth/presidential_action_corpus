        <p id="p-2" data-page="88609">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of the United States to prevent the introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive species, as well as to eradicate and control populations of invasive species that are established. Invasive species pose threats to prosperity, security, and quality of life. They have negative impacts on the environment and natural resources, agriculture and food production systems, water resources, human, animal, and plant health, infrastructure, the economy, energy, cultural resources, and military readiness. Every year, invasive species cost the United States billions of dollars in economic losses and other damages.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="88609">Of substantial growing concern are invasive species that are or may be vectors, reservoirs, and causative agents of disease, which threaten human, animal, and plant health. The introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive species create the potential for serious public health impacts, especially when considered in the context of changing climate conditions. Climate change influences the establishment, spread, and impacts of invasive species.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="88609"><a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13112">Executive Order 13112</a> of February 3, 1999 (Invasive Species), called upon executive departments and agencies to take steps to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species, and to support efforts to eradicate and control invasive species that are established. <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13112">Executive Order 13112</a> also created a coordinating body&mdash;the Invasive Species Council, also referred to as the National Invasive Species Council&mdash;to oversee implementation of the order, encourage proactive planning and action, develop recommendations for international cooperation, and take other steps to improve the Federal response to invasive species. Past efforts at preventing, eradicating, and controlling invasive species demonstrated that collaboration across Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial government; stakeholders; and the private sector is critical to minimizing the spread of invasive species and that coordinated action is necessary to protect the assets and security of the United States.</p>

        <p id="p-5" data-page="88609">This order amends <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13112">Executive Order 13112</a> and directs actions to continue coordinated Federal prevention and control efforts related to invasive species. This order maintains the National Invasive Species Council (Council) and the Invasive Species Advisory Committee; expands the membership of the Council; clarifies the operations of the Council; incorporates considerations <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="88610"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-88610" data-page="88610" data-text="Start Printed Page 88610" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 88610}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 88610</span></span></span>of human and environmental health, climate change, technological innovation, and other emerging priorities into Federal efforts to address invasive species; and strengthens coordinated, cost-efficient Federal action.</p>
