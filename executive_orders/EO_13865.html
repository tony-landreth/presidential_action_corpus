          <h1 id="h-1">Coordinating National Resilience to Electromagnetic Pulses</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="12041">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="12041">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) has the potential to disrupt, degrade, and damage technology and critical infrastructure systems. Human-made or naturally occurring EMPs can affect large geographic areas, disrupting elements critical to the Nation's security and economic prosperity, and could adversely affect global commerce and stability. The Federal Government must foster sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective approaches to improving the Nation's resilience to the effects of EMPs.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="12041">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Definitions.</em> As used in this order:</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="12041">(a) &ldquo;Critical infrastructure&rdquo; means systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="12041">(b) &ldquo;Electromagnetic pulse&rdquo; is a burst of electromagnetic energy. EMPs have the potential to negatively affect technology systems on Earth and in space. A high-altitude EMP (HEMP) is a type of human-made EMP that occurs when a nuclear device is detonated at approximately 40 kilometers or more above the surface of Earth. A geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) is a type of natural EMP driven by a temporary disturbance of Earth's magnetic field resulting from interactions with solar eruptions. Both HEMPs and GMDs can affect large geographic areas.</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="12041">(c) &ldquo;National Critical Functions&rdquo; means the functions of government and the private sector so vital to the United States that their disruption, corruption, or dysfunction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof.</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="12041">(d) &ldquo;National Essential Functions&rdquo; means the overarching responsibilities of the Federal Government to lead and sustain the Nation before, during, and in the aftermath of a catastrophic emergency, such as an EMP that adversely affects the performance of Government.</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="12041">(e) &ldquo;Prepare&rdquo; and &ldquo;preparedness&rdquo; mean the actions taken to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise to build and sustain the capabilities necessary to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from those threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation. These terms include the prediction and notification of impending EMPs.</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="12041">(f) A &ldquo;Sector-Specific Agency&rdquo; (SSA) is the Federal department or agency that is responsible for providing institutional knowledge and specialized expertise as well as leading, facilitating, or supporting the security and resilience programs and associated activities of its designated critical infrastructure sector in the all-hazards environment. The SSAs are those identified in Presidential Policy Directive 21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience).</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="12041">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> (a) It is the policy of the United States to prepare for the effects of EMPs through targeted approaches that coordinate whole-of-government activities and encourage private-sector engagement.

To achieve these goals, the Federal Government shall engage in risk-informed planning, prioritize research and development (R&amp;D) to address the needs of critical infrastructure stakeholders, and, for adversarial threats, consult Intelligence Community assessments.</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="12042">(b) To implement the actions directed in this order, the Federal Government shall promote collaboration and facilitate information sharing, including the sharing of threat and vulnerability assessments, among executive departments and agencies (agencies), the owners and operators of critical infrastructure, and other relevant stakeholders, as appropriate. The Federal Government shall also provide incentives, as appropriate, to private-sector partners to encourage innovation that strengthens critical infrastructure against the effects of EMPs through the development and implementation of best practices, regulations, and appropriate guidance.</p>
          
          <p id="p-12" data-page="12042">
