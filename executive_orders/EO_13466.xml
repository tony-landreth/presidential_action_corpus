        <EXECORDR>Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008</EXECORDR>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">Continuing Certain Restrictions With Respect to North Korea and North Korean Nationals</HD>

        <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq</E>.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq</E>.) (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, </FP>

        <FP>I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the current existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I further find that, as we deal with that threat through multilateral diplomacy, it is necessary to continue certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise be lifted pursuant to a forthcoming proclamation that will terminate the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1 <E T="03">et seq</E>.) (TWEA) with respect to North Korea. </FP>

App. 5(b) note), were blocked as of June 16, 2000, and remained blocked immediately prior to the date of this order. </FP>
