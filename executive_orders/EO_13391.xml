          <HD SOURCE="HED">Blocking Property of Additional Persons Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Zimbabwe</HD>

          <FP>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq</E>.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq</E>.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to take additional steps with respect to the continued actions and policies of certain persons who undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes and with respect to the national emergency described and declared in Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003,</FP>
          <FP>I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby order:</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Section 1.</E> The Annex to Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, is replaced and superseded in its entirety by the Annex to this order.</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E> Section 6 of Executive Order 13288 is renumbered as section 8. Sections 1 through 5 of Executive Order 13288 are replaced with new sections 1 through 7 as follows:</FP>
          <P>“<E T="04">Section 1.</E> (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), and in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all property and interests in property of the following persons, that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons, including their overseas branches, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and</P>
          <P SOURCE="P1">(ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:</P>
          <P SOURCE="P2"> (A) to have engaged in actions or policies to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P2"> (B) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, such actions or policies or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order;</P>
          <P SOURCE="P2"> (C) to be or have been an immediate family member of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or</P>
          <P SOURCE="P2"> (D) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.</P>

          <P> (b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by paragraph (a) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="71202"/>
          </P>
          <P> (c) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include but are not limited to (i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order, and (ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="04">Sec. 2.</E> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</P>
          <P> (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="04">Sec. 3.</E> For the purposes of this order:</P>
          <P> (a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</P>
          <P> (b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and</P>
          <P> (c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="04">Sec. 4.</E> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that, for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this order.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="04">Sec. 5.</E> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="04">Sec. 6.</E> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine, subsequent to the issuance of this order, that circumstances no longer warrant the inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and that the property and interests in property of that person are therefore no longer blocked pursuant to section 1(a) of this order.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="04">Sec. 7.</E> This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.”</P>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 3.</E> This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</FP>
          <FP>
            <E T="04">Sec. 4.</E> This order shall take effect at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time, November 23, 2005.<PRTPAGE P="71203"/>
