Accordingly, I hereby order:</p>

            <strong>Section 1.</strong> (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person (including any foreign branch) of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:</p>

          <p id="p-16" data-page="15536">
            <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13660">Executive Order 13660,</a> and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>

          <p id="p-19" data-page="15536">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="15536">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 6.</strong> For the purposes of this order:</p>

            <strong>Sec. 7.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13660">Executive Order 13660,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>

The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
