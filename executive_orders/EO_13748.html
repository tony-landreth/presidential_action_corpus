          <h1 id="h-1">Establishing a Community Solutions Council</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="83619">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="83619">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> Place is a strong determinant of opportunity and well-being. Research shows that the neighborhood in which a child grows up impacts his or her odds of going to college, enjoying good health, and obtaining a lifetime of economic opportunities. Even after 73 consecutive months of total job growth since 2009, communities of persistent poverty remain and for far too many, the odds are stacked against opportunity and achieving the American dream. In addition, between now and 2050, growing our economy, expected population growth, climate change, and demographic shifts will require major new investments in physical, social, and technological infrastructure.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="83619">Specific challenges in communities&mdash;including crime, access to care, opportunities to pursue quality education, lack of housing options, unemployment, and deteriorating infrastructure&mdash;can be met by leveraging Federal assistance and resources. While the Federal Government provides rural, suburban, urban, and tribal communities with significant investments in aid annually, coordinating these investments, as appropriate, across agencies based on locally led visions can more effectively reach communities of greatest need to maximize impact. In recent years, the Federal Government has deepened its engagement with communities, recognizing the critical role of these partnerships in enabling Americans to live healthier and more prosperous lives. Since 2015, the Community Solutions Task Force, comprising executive departments, offices, and agencies (agencies) across the Federal Government, has served as the primary interagency coordinator of agency work to engage with communities to deliver improved outcomes. This order builds on recent work to facilitate inter-agency and community-level collaboration to meet the unique needs of communities in a way that reflects these communities' local assets, economies, geography, size, history, strengths, talent networks, and visions for the future.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="83619">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Principles.</em> Our effort to modernize the Federal Government's work with communities is rooted in the following principles:</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="83619">(a) A community-driven, locally led vision and long-term plan for clear outcomes should guide individual projects.</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="83619">(b) The Federal Government should coordinate its efforts at the Federal, regional, State, local, tribal, and community level, and with cross-sector partners, to offer a more seamless process for communities to access needed support and ensure equitable investments.</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="83619">(c) The Federal Government should help communities identify, develop, and share local solutions, rely on data to determine what does and does not work, and harness technology and modern collaboration and engagement methods to help share these solutions and help communities meet their local goals.</p>
