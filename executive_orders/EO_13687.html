          <h1 id="h-1">Imposing Additional Sanctions With Respect To North Korea</h1>

          <p id="p-1" data-page="819">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq.</em>), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=8&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1182&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1182</a>(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code; and in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1718 of October 14, 2006, UNSCR 1874 of June 12, 2009, UNSCR 2087 of January 22, 2013, and UNSCR 2094 of March 7, 2013,</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="819">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014, actions in violation of UNSCRs 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094, and commission of serious human rights abuses, constitute a continuing threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466</a> of June 26, 2008, expanded in scope in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13551">Executive Order 13551</a> of August 30, 2010, and relied upon for additional steps in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13570">Executive Order 13570</a> of April 18, 2011. To address this threat and to take further steps with respect to this national emergency, I hereby order:</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="819">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:</p>
          (i) to be an agency, instrumentality, or controlled entity of the Government of North Korea or the Workers' Party of Korea;
          (ii) to be an official of the Government of North Korea;
          (iii) to be an official of the Workers' Party of Korea;
          (iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, the Government of North Korea or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or
          (v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of North Korea or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
          <p id="p-9" data-page="819">(b) The prohibitions in this order apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="819">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="820"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-820" data-page="820" data-text="Start Printed Page 820" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 820}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 820</span></span></span>13466, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="820">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. The prohibitions in this order include but are not limited to:</p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="820">(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="820">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
          <p id="p-14" data-page="820">
            <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>
          <p id="p-15" data-page="820">
            <strong>Sec. 5</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-16" data-page="820">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-17" data-page="820">
            <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="820">(a) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-19" data-page="820">(b) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>
          <p id="p-20" data-page="820">(c) the term &ldquo;United States person&rdquo; means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and</p>
          <p id="p-21" data-page="820">(d) the term &ldquo;Government of North Korea&rdquo; means the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities.</p>
          <p id="p-22" data-page="820">
            <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-23" data-page="820">
            <strong>Sec. 8</strong>. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
