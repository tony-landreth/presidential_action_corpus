        <h1 id="h-1">President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="8923">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to promote the economic, academic, and social benefits of youth sports, fitness, and nutrition, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="8923">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Revocation.</em> <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13545">Executive Order 13545</a> of June 22, 2010, is hereby revoked.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Amendment.</em> <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13265">Executive Order 13265</a> of June 6, 2002, is hereby amended as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="8923">(a) The title is revised to read as follows: &ldquo;President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.&rdquo;</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="8923">(b) The preamble is revised to replace the phrase, &ldquo;President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports&rdquo; with &ldquo;President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.&rdquo;</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="8923">(c) Sections 1 through 5 are revised to read as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="8923">&ldquo;<strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> My Administration recognizes the benefits of youth sports participation, physical activity, and a nutritious diet in helping create habits that support a healthy lifestyle and improve the overall health of the American people. My Administration therefore aims to expand and encourage youth sports participation, and to promote the overall physical fitness, health, and nutrition of all Americans.</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="8923">Good health, including physical activity and proper nutrition, supports Americans', particularly children's, well-being, growth, and development. Participating in sports allows children to experience the connection between effort and success, and it enhances their academic, economic, and social prospects. Many of America's leaders attribute their lifetime achievements to lessons learned through sports participation and athletic activity. Additionally, youth sports help working parents and guardians by providing their children opportunities to engage in productive, positive activities outside of school. Unfortunately, during the past decade youth participation in team sports has declined. As of 2016, only 37 percent of children played team sports on a regular basis, down from 45 percent in 2008. Particularly troubling is that sports participation disproportionately lags among young girls and children who are from economically distressed areas.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> (a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), in carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities for public health and human services, shall develop a national strategy to expand children's participation in youth sports, encourage regular physical activity, including active play, and promote good nutrition for all Americans.
