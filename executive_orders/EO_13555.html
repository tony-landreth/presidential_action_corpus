          <h1 id="h-1">White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="65417">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, to restore the country to its role as the global leader in education, to strengthen the Nation by expanding educational opportunities and improving educational outcomes for Hispanics and Latinos (Hispanics) of all ages, and to help ensure that all Hispanics receive an education that properly prepares them for college, productive careers, and satisfying lives, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="65417">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em>Policy. </em> At more than 52 million strong, including 4 million in Puerto Rico, Hispanics constitute the country's largest and fastest growing minority group.  They have had a profound and positive impact on our country through, among other things, their community's strong commitment to family, faith, hard work, and service.  Many Hispanics contribute to this Nation bilingually in the English and Spanish languages&mdash;a true asset for our country in an increasingly global, interdependent world.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="65417">Hispanic students are the largest minority group in our Nation's schools, numbering more than 11 million in our public elementary and secondary school system, and constituting more than 22 percent of all pre-K-12 students.  Hispanic students face educational challenges of crisis proportions.  Fewer than half of all Hispanic children participate in early childhood education programs, and far too few Hispanic students graduate from high school; of those who do complete high school, many are not adequately prepared for college.  Only 12 percent of adult Hispanics have a bachelor's degree, and just 3 percent have completed graduate or professional degree programs.  At the same time, large numbers of Hispanic adults lack the education or literacy skills they need to advance their careers; they also are less likely than members of other groups to have taken job- or career-related courses, with the exception of basic education classes, such as English as a second language.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="65417">Our country was built on and continues to thrive on its diversity, and there is no doubt that the future of the United States is inextricably linked to the future of the Hispanic community.  To reach the ambitious education goals we have set for our Nation, as well as to ensure equality of opportunity for all, we must provide the opportunities that will enable Hispanic students to raise their educational attainment at every level of the American education system.  America's future competitiveness in our global economy will be substantially enhanced by improving educational outcomes for Hispanics.</p>
