        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13955">Executive Order 13955</a> of October 13, 2020
        <h1 id="h-1">Establishing the One Trillion Trees Interagency Council</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="65643">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="65643">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose</em>. As I declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13855">Executive Order 13855</a> of December 21, 2018 (Promoting Active Management of America's Forests, Rangelands, and Other Federal Lands To Improve Conditions and Reduce Wildfire Risk), it is the policy of the United States to promote healthy and resilient forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands by actively managing them through partnerships with States, tribes, communities, non-profit organizations, and the private sector. </p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="65643">Our Nation is home to hundreds of millions of acres of Federal, State, tribal, and private forests and woodlands, which produce tremendous positive economic and environmental effects throughout our country. Recreational and educational visits to National Forests make substantial contributions to our Nation's physical and emotional health as well as to our gross domestic product, all while supporting thousands of full- and part-time jobs. Our Nation's forests and woodlands provide valuable environmental benefits as well, including by serving as wildlife habitats and supporting air and water quality for all Americans. Forests and woodlands sequester atmospheric carbon, and according to the Forest Service, 180 million people in over 68,000 communities rely on our Nation's forested watersheds to capture and filter their drinking water.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="65643">These facts demonstrate how our Nation has taken advantage of the tremendous economic and environmental benefits associated with tree growth and forestation. By advancing Federal policies conducive to these practices, under my leadership, the United States has promoted greater use of nature-based solutions to address global challenges.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="65643">On January 21, 2020, I announced that to further protect the environment, the United States would be joining the World Economic Forum's One Trillion Trees initiative (Initiative), an ambitious global effort to grow and conserve one trillion trees worldwide by 2030. Following through on my commitment, and given the expansive footprint of our Federal forests and woodlands, this order initiates the formation of the United States One Trillion Trees Interagency Council to further the Federal Government's contribution to the global effort. </p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="65643">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>United States One Trillion Trees Interagency Council</em>. There is hereby established a United States One Trillion Trees Interagency Council (Council).
