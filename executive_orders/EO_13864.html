          <h1 id="h-1">Improving Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability at Colleges and Universities</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="11401">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="11401">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> The purpose of this order is to enhance the quality of postsecondary education by making it more affordable, more transparent, and more accountable. Institutions of higher education (institutions) should be accountable both for student outcomes and for student life on campus.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="11401">In particular, my Administration seeks to promote free and open debate on college and university campuses. Free inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation's democracy, and it promotes learning, scientific discovery, and economic prosperity. We must encourage institutions to appropriately account for this bedrock principle in their administration of student life and to avoid creating environments that stifle competing perspectives, thereby potentially impeding beneficial research and undermining learning.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="11401">The financial burden of higher education on students and their families is also a national problem that needs immediate attention. Over the past 30 years, college tuition and fees have grown at more than twice the rate of the Consumer Price Index. Rising student loan debt, coupled with low repayment rates, threatens the financial health of both individuals and families as well as of Federal student loan programs. In addition, too many programs of study fail to prepare students for success in today's job market.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="11401">The Federal Government can take meaningful steps to address these problems. Selecting an institution and course of study are important decisions for prospective students and significantly affect long-term earnings. Institutions should be transparent about the average earnings and loan repayment rates of former students who received Federal student aid. Additionally, the Federal Government should make this information readily accessible to the public and to prospective students and their families, in particular.</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="11401">This order will promote greater access to critical information regarding the prices and outcomes of postsecondary education, thereby furthering the goals of the National Council for the American Worker established by <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13845">Executive Order 13845</a> of July 19, 2018 (Establishing the President's National Council for the American Worker). Increased information disclosure will help ensure that individuals make educational choices suited to their needs, interests, and circumstances. Access to this information will also increase institutional accountability and encourage institutions to take into account likely future earnings when establishing the cost of their educational programs.</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="11401">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of the Federal Government to:</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="11401">(a) encourage institutions to foster environments that promote open, intellectually engaging, and diverse debate, including through compliance with the First Amendment for public institutions and compliance with stated institutional policies regarding freedom of speech for private institutions;</p>

          <p id="p-9" data-page="11401">(b) help students (including workers seeking additional training) and their families understand, through better data and career counseling, that not all institutions, degrees, or fields of study provide similar returns on their investment, and consider that their educational decisions should account for the opportunity cost of enrolling in a program;<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="11402"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-11402" data-page="11402" data-text="Start Printed Page 11402" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 11402}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 11402</span></span></span>
          </p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="11402">(c) align the incentives of institutions with those of students and taxpayers to ensure that institutions share the financial risk associated with Federal student loan programs;</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="11402">(d) help borrowers avoid defaulting on their Federal student loans by educating them about risks, repayment obligations, and repayment options; and</p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="11402">(e) supplement efforts by States and institutions by disseminating information to assist students in completing their degrees faster and at lower cost.</p>
