        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13812">Executive Order 13812</a> of September 29, 2017
        <h1 id="h-1">Revocation of Executive Order Creating Labor-Management Forums</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="46367">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="46367">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy</em>. The United States Government should spend tax dollars responsibly, efficiently, and in the public interest. The National Council on Federal Labor-Management Relations (Council) and related agency-level labor-management forums have consumed considerable managerial time and taxpayer resources, but they have not fulfilled their goal of promoting collaboration in the Federal workforce. Public expenditures on the Council and related forums have produced few benefits to the public, and they should, therefore, be discontinued.</p>
