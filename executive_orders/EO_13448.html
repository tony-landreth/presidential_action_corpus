            <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13047">Executive Order 13047,</a> and relied upon for additional steps taken in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13310">Executive Order 13310,</a> and expanded in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this order. </p>
