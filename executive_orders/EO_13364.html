        <h1 id="h-1">Modifying the Protection Granted to the Development Fund for Iraq and Certain Property in Which Iraq Has an Interest and Protecting the Central Bank of Iraq</h1>

        <p id="p-1" data-page="70177">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq</em>.)

        <p id="p-2" data-page="70177">I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby modify the scope of the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13303">Executive Order 13303</a> of May 22, 2003, and expanded in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13315">Executive Order 13315</a> of August 28, 2003, and further modified in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13350">Executive Order 13350</a> of July 29, 2004, to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in that country, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. I find that the threat of attachment or other judicial process against the Central Bank of Iraq constitutes one of these obstacles. I further determine that, consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1483 of May 22, 2003, and 1546 of June 8, 2004, the steps taken in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13303">Executive Order 13303</a> to deal with the national emergency declared therein need to be limited so that such steps do not apply with respect to any final judgment arising out of a contractual obligation entered into by the Government of Iraq, including any agency or instrumentality thereof, after June 30, 2004, and so that, with respect to Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products and interests therein, such steps shall apply only until title passes to the initial purchaser. </p>
