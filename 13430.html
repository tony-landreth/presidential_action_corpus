          <h1 id="h-1">2007 Amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="20213">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code (Uniform Code of Military Justice, <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=10&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=801&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">10 U.S.C. 801</a>-946), and in order to prescribe amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, prescribed by Executive Order 12473 of April 13, 1984, as amended, it is hereby ordered as follows: </p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="20213">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong> Part II of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, is amended as follows: </p>
          (a) R.C.M. 703(b)(1) is amended by adding at the end the following new sentences: 
          “With the consent of both the accused and Government, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify via remote means. Over a party's objection, the military judge may authorize any witness to testify on interlocutory questions via remote means or similar technology if the practical difficulties of producing the witness outweigh the significance of the witness' personal appearance (although such testimony will not be admissible over the accused's objection as evidence on the ultimate issue of guilt). Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, the costs of producing the witness; the timing of the request for production of the witness; the potential delay in the interlocutory proceeding that may be caused by the production of the witness; the willingness of the witness to testify in person; the likelihood of significant interference with military operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential training; and, for child witnesses, the traumatic effect of providing in-court testimony.” 
          (b) R.C.M. 804 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) as paragraphs (c), (d), and (e), respectively, and inserting the following new paragraph (b): 
          “(b) <em>Presence by remote means</em>. If authorized by the regulations of the Secretary concerned, the military judge may order the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology, between the parties and the military judge for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions. Use of such audiovisual technology will satisfy the “presence” requirement of the accused only when the accused has a defense counsel physically present at his location. Such technology may include two or more remote sites as long as all parties can see and hear each other.” 
          (c) R.C.M. 804(c)(2) is redesignated as R.C.M. 804(d)(2) and amended to read as follows: 
          “(2) <em>Procedure</em>. The accused's absence will be conditional upon his being able to view the witness' testimony from a remote location. Normally, transmission of the testimony will include a system that will transmit the accused's image and voice into the courtroom from a remote location as well as transmission of the child's testimony from the courtroom to the accused's location. A one-way transmission may be used if deemed necessary by the military judge. The accused will also be provided private, <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="20214"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-20214" data-page="20214" data-text="Start Printed Page 20214" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 20214}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 20214</span></span></span>contemporaneous communication with his counsel. The procedures described herein shall be employed unless the accused has made a knowing and affirmative waiver of these procedures.” 
          (d) R.C.M. 805(a) is amended by adding at the end the following new sentence: 
          “If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions solely, the presence of the military judge at Article 39(a) sessions may be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology.” 
          (e) R.C.M. 805(c) is amended by adding at the end the following new sentences: 
          “If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, for purposes of Article 39(a) sessions solely, the presence of counsel at Article 39(a) sessions may be satisfied by the use of audiovisual technology, such as videoteleconferencing technology. At least one qualified defense counsel shall be physically present with the accused.” 
          (f) R.C.M. 914A is amended by deleting the third sentence of paragraph (a). 
          (g) R.C.M. 914A is further amended by redesignating paragraph (b) as paragraph (c) and inserting the following new paragraph (b): 
          “(b) <em>Definition</em>. As used in this rule, “remote live testimony” includes, but is not limited to, testimony by videoteleconference, closed circuit television, or similar technology.” 
          (h) New Rule R.C.M. 914B is inserted after R.C.M. 914A: 
          “Rule 914B. Use of remote testimony. 
          (a) <em>General procedures</em>. The military judge shall determine the procedures used to take testimony via remote means. At a minimum, all parties shall be able to hear each other, those in attendance at the remote site shall be identified, and the accused shall be permitted private, contemporaneous communication with his counsel. 
          (b) <em>Definition</em>. As used in this rule, testimony via “remote means” includes, but is not limited to, testimony by videoteleconference, closed circuit television, telephone, or similar technology.” 
          (i) R.C.M. 1001(e)(2)(D) is amended by deleting the “or” before “former testimony” and inserting “, or testimony by remote means” after “former testimony.”

            <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> Part IV of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, is amended as follows: </p>
          (a) Paragraph 4.c.(6) is amended by redesignating paragraph (f) as paragraph (g) and inserting the following new paragraph (f):

          (A) In the case of the operation or control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel in the United States, such limit is the lesser of — 
          (i) the blood alcohol content limit under the law of the State in which the conduct occurred, except as may be provided under paragraph (2) for conduct on a military installation that is in more than one State; or 
          (ii) the blood alcohol content limit specified in paragraph (3). 
          (B) In the case of the operation or control of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel outside the United States, the applicable blood alcohol content limit is the blood alcohol content limit specified in paragraph (3) or such lower limit as the Secretary of Defense may by regulation prescribe. 
          (2) In the case of a military installation that is in more than one State, if those States have different blood alcohol content limits under their respective State laws, the Secretary may select one such blood alcohol content limit to apply uniformly on that installation. 
          (3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the blood alcohol content limit with respect to alcohol concentration in a person's blood is 0.10 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood and with respect to alcohol concentration in a person's breath is 0.10 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath, as shown by chemical analysis.

          (B) The term “United States” includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa and the term “State” includes each of those jurisdictions. 
          (d) Paragraph 35b(2)(c) is amended to read as follows: 
          “(c) the alcohol concentration in the accused's blood or breath equaled to or exceeded the applicable limit under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 35a. [NOTE: If injury resulted add the following element]” 
          (e) Para 35f is amended to read as follows: 
          “In that _________ (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/onboard location)(subject matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about _______ 20__, (in the motor pool area)(near the Officer's Club)(at the intersection of _____ and ______)(while in the Gulf of Mexico)(while in flight over North America) physically control [a vehicle, to wit: (a truck)(a passenger car)(______)] [an aircraft, to wit: (an AH 64 helicopter)(an F 14 A fighter)(a KC 135 tanker)(_________)][a vessel, to wit: (the aircraft carrier USS)(the Coast Cutter)(_____)], [while drunk][while impaired by _____][while the alcohol concentration in his (blood or breath equaled or exceeded the applicable limit under subparagraph (b) of paragraph 35a) as shown by chemical analysis][in a (reckless)(wanton) manner by (attempting to pass another vehicle on a sharp curve)(by ordering that the aircraft be flown below the authorized altitude)][and did thereby cause said (vehicle)(aircraft)(vessel) to (strike and )(injure _________)].”

          <p id="p-75" data-page="20217">c. <em>Explanation</em>. </p>
          (1) <em>Nature of offense</em>. This article makes it a separate, punishable crime to cause the death of or bodily injury to an unborn child while engaged in arson (article 126, UCMJ); murder (article 118, UCMJ); voluntary manslaughter (article 119(a), UCMJ); involuntary manslaughter (article 119(b)(2), UCMJ); rape (article 120(a), UCMJ); robbery (article 122, UCMJ); maiming (article 124, UCMJ); or assault (article 128, UCMJ) against a pregnant woman. For all underlying offenses, except arson, this article requires that the victim of the underlying offense be the pregnant mother. For purposes of arson, the pregnant mother must have some nexus to the arson such that she sustained some “bodily injury” due to the arson. For the purposes of this article the term “woman” means a female of any age. This article does not permit the prosecution of any — 
          (a) person for conduct relating to an abortion for which the consent of the pregnant woman, or a person authorized by law to act on her behalf, has been obtained or for which such consent is implied by law; 
          (b) person for any medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn child; or 
          (c) woman with respect to her unborn child. 
          (2) The offenses of “injuring an unborn child” and “killing an unborn child” do not require proof that — 
          (a) the person engaging in the conduct (the accused) had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or 
          (b) the accused intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child. 
          (3) The offense of “attempting to kill an unborn child” requires that the accused intended by his conduct to cause the death of the unborn child (See paragraph b(3)(c) above). 
          (4) <em>Bodily injury</em>. For the purpose of this offense, the term “bodily injury” is that which is provided by section 1365 of title 18, to wit: a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, or disfigurement; physical pain; illness; impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or any other injury to the body, no matter how temporary. 
          (5) <em>Unborn child</em>. “Unborn child” means a child in utero or a member of the species homo sapiens who is carried in the womb, at any stage of development, from conception to birth. <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="20218"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-20218" data-page="20218" data-text="Start Printed Page 20218" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 20218}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 20218</span></span></span>
