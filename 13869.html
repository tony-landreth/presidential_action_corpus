          <h1 id="h-1">Transferring Responsibility for Background Investigations to the Department of Defense</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="18125">By the power vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Findings and Purpose.</em> Section 925 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/1564?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">10 U.S.C. 1564</a> note) provides that the Secretary of Defense has the authority to conduct security, suitability, and credentialing background investigations for Department of Defense personnel and requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to provide for a phased transition to the Department of Defense of the conduct of such investigations conducted by the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB). Implementing that legislative mandate while retaining the benefit of economies of scale in addressing the Federal Government's background investigations workload, avoiding unnecessary risk, promoting the ongoing alignment of efforts with respect to vetting Federal employees and contractors, and facilitating needed reforms in this critical area requires that the primary responsibility for conducting background investigations Government-wide be transferred from the Office of Personnel Management to the Department of Defense.</p>
