        <h1 id="h-1">Evaluating and Improving the Utility of Federal Advisory Committees</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="28711">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and consistent with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="28711">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Review of Current Advisory Committees.</em> (a) Each executive department and agency (agency) shall evaluate the need for each of its current advisory committees established under section 9(a)(2) of FACA and those advisory committees established under section 9(a)(1) that are authorized by law but not required by statute (eligible committees).</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="28711">(b) Each agency shall, by September 30, 2019, terminate at least one-third of its current committees established under section 9(a)(2) of FACA, including committees for which the:</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-4" data-page="28711">(i) stated objectives of the committee have been accomplished;</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-5" data-page="28711">(ii) subject matter or work of the committee has become obsolete;</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-6" data-page="28711">(iii) primary functions have been assumed by another entity; or</p>
        <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-7" data-page="28711">(iv) agency determines that the cost of operation is excessive in relation to the benefits to the Federal Government.</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="28711">(c) Each agency may request a waiver of the requirement in subsection (b) of this section from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director). The Director may grant such a waiver if the Director concludes it is necessary for the delivery of essential services, for effective program delivery, or because it is otherwise warranted by the public interest.</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="28711">(d) Each agency that has fewer than three current eligible committees is exempt from subsection (b) of this section.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="28711">(e) Agencies may count eligible committees terminated since January 20, 2017, toward the requirement of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="28711">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Limitations on New Advisory Committees.</em> The Government-wide combined total number of eligible committees (excluding committees covered by section 6(d) of this order) shall not exceed 350. If the combined total number of eligible committees exceeds 350, an agency may not establish a new advisory committee under section 9(a)(2) of FACA, unless the agency obtains a waiver pursuant to subsection 4(b) of this order. Such a waiver is in addition to the notice and other requirements of FACA and its implementing regulations.</p>
