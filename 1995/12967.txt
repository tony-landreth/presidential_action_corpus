                Executive Order 12967 of July 31, 1995

                
Establishing an Emergency Board To Investigate 
                Disputes Between Metro North Commuter Railroad and Its 
                Employees Represented by Certain Labor Organizations

                Disputes exist between Metro North Commuter Railroad 
                and certain employees represented by certain labor 
                organizations. The labor organizations involved in 
                these disputes are designated on the attached list, 
                which is made a part of this order.

                The disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under 
                the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 
                U.S.C. 151 et seq.) (the ``Act'').

                Parties empowered by the Act have requested that the 
                President establish a second emergency board pursuant 
                to section 9A of the Act (45 U.S.C. 159a).

                Section 9A(e) of the Act provides that the President, 
                upon such request, shall appoint a second emergency 
                board to investigate and report on the disputes.

                NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as 
                President by the Constitution and the laws of the 
                United States of America, including section 9A of the 
                Act, it is hereby ordered as follows:

                Section 1. Establishment of the Board. There is 
                established effective July 31, 1995, a board of three 
                members to be appointed by the President to investigate 
                these disputes. No member shall be pecuniarily or 
                otherwise interested in any organization of railroad 
                employees or any carrier. The board shall perform its 
                functions subject to the availability of funds.

                Sec. 2. Report. Within 30 days after creation of the 
                board, the parties to the disputes shall submit to the 
                board final offers for settlement of the disputes. 
                Within 30 days after submission of final offers for 
                settlement of the disputes, the board shall submit a 
                report to the President setting forth its selection of 
                the most reasonable offer.

                Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 
                9A(h) of the Act, from the time a request to establish 
                a board is made until 60 days after the board makes its 
                report, no change, except by agreement, shall be made 
                by the parties in the conditions out of which the 
                disputes arose.

                Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of 
                the board are records of the Office of the President 
                and upon the board's termination shall be maintained in 
                the physical custody of the National Mediation Board.

                Sec. 5. Expiration. The board shall terminate upon 
                submission of the report provided for in section 2 of 
                this order.

                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,

                    July 31, 1995.
