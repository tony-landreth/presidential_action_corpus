                Israel-United States Binational Industrial Research and 
                Development Foundation

                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
                America, including section 1 of the International 
                Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288), and 
                having found that the Israel-United States Binational 
                Industrial Research and Development Foundation is a 
                public international organization in which the United 
                States participates within the meaning of the 
                International Organizations Immunities Act, I hereby 
                designate the Israel-United States Binational 
                Industrial Research and Development Foundation as a 
                public international organization entitled to enjoy the 
                privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the 
                International Organizations Immunities Act. This 
                designation is not intended to abridge in any respect 
                the privileges, exemptions, or immunities that such 
                organization may have acquired or may acquire by 
                international agreements or by congressional action.

                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,
