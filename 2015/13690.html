        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13690">Executive Order 13690</a> of January 30, 2015
        <h1 id="h-1">Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="6425">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve the Nation's resilience to current and future flood risk, I hereby direct the following:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="6425">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of the United States to improve the resilience of communities and Federal assets against the impacts of flooding. These impacts are anticipated to increase over time due to the effects of climate change and other threats. Losses caused by flooding affect the environment, our economic prosperity, and public health and safety, each of which affects our national security.</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="6425">The Federal Government must take action, informed by the best-available and actionable science, to improve the Nation's preparedness and resilience against flooding. Executive Order 11988 of May 24, 1977 (Floodplain Management), requires executive departments and agencies (agencies) to avoid, to the extent possible, the long- and short-term adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains and to avoid direct or indirect support of floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative. The Federal Government has developed processes for evaluating the impacts of Federal actions in or affecting floodplains to implement Executive Order 11988.</p>

        <p id="p-4" data-page="6425">As part of a national policy on resilience and risk reduction consistent with my <em>Climate Action Plan,</em> the National Security Council staff coordinated an interagency effort to create a new flood risk reduction standard for federally funded projects. The views of Governors, mayors, and other stakeholders were solicited and considered as efforts were made to establish a new flood risk reduction standard for federally funded projects. The result of these efforts is the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (Standard), a flexible framework to increase resilience against flooding and help preserve the natural values of floodplains. Incorporating this Standard will ensure that agencies expand management from the current base flood level to a higher vertical elevation and corresponding horizontal floodplain to address current and future flood risk and ensure that projects funded with taxpayer dollars last as long as intended.</p>
        <p id="p-5" data-page="6425">This order establishes the Standard and sets forth a process for further solicitation and consideration of public input, including from Governors, mayors, and other stakeholders, prior to implementation of the Standard.</p>
        <p id="p-6" data-page="6425">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Amendments to Executive Order 11988.</em> Executive Order 11988 is amended as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="6425">(a) Section 2 is amended by inserting “, to the extent permitted by law” after “as follows”.</p>

        <p id="p-8" data-page="6425">(b) Section 2(a)(1) is amended by striking “This Determination shall be made according to a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) floodplain map or a more detailed map of an area, if available. If such maps are not available, the agency shall make a determination of the location of the floodplain based on the best-available information. The Water Resources Council shall issue guidance on this information not later than October 1, 1977” and inserting in lieu thereof “To determine whether the <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="6426"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-6426" data-page="6426" data-text="Start Printed Page 6426" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 6426}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 6426</span></span></span>action is located in a floodplain, the agency shall use one of the approaches in Section 6(c) of this Order based on the best-available information and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's effective Flood Insurance Rate Map”.</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="6426">(c) Section 2(a)(2) is amended by inserting the following sentence after the first sentence:</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="6426">“Where possible, an agency shall use natural systems, ecosystem processes, and nature-based approaches when developing alternatives for consideration.”.</p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="6426">(d) Section 2(d) is amended by striking “Director” and inserting “Administrator” in lieu thereof.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="6426">(e) Section 3(a) is amended by inserting the following sentence after the first sentence:</p>

        <p id="p-14" data-page="6426">(f) Section 3(a) is further amended by inserting “and FFRMS” after “Flood Insurance Program”.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="6426">(g) Section 3(b) is amended by striking “base flood level” and inserting “elevation of the floodplain as defined in Section 6(c) of this Order” in lieu thereof.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="6426">(h) Section 4 is revised to read as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="6426">“In addition to any responsibilities under this Order and Sections 102, 202, and 205 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=42&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=4012&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">42 U.S.C. 4012</a>a, 4106, and 4128), agencies which guarantee, approve, regulate, or insure any financial transaction which is related to an area located in an area subject to the base flood shall, prior to completing action on such transaction, inform any private parties participating in the transaction of the hazards of locating structures in the area subject to the base flood.”.</p>
        (i) Section 6(c) is amended by striking “, including at a minimum, that area subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year” and inserting in lieu thereof:
        <p id="p-19" data-page="6426">“. The floodplain shall be established using one of the following approaches:</p>
        <p id="p-20" data-page="6426">“(1) Unless an exception is made under paragraph (2), the floodplain shall be:</p>
        “(i) the elevation and flood hazard area that result from using a climate-informed science approach that uses the best-available, actionable hydrologic and hydraulic data and methods that integrate current and future changes in flooding based on climate science. This approach will also include an emphasis on whether the action is a critical action as one of the factors to be considered when conducting the analysis;
        “(ii) the elevation and flood hazard area that result from using the freeboard value, reached by adding an additional 2 feet to the base flood elevation for non-critical actions and by adding an additional 3 feet to the base flood elevation for critical actions;
        “(iii) the area subject to flooding by the 0.2 percent annual chance flood; or
        “(iv) the elevation and flood hazard area that result from using any other method identified in an update to the FFRMS.

        <p id="p-25" data-page="6426">“(2) The head of an agency may except an agency action from paragraph (1) where it is in the interest of national security, where the agency action is an emergency action, where application to a Federal facility or structure is demonstrably inappropriate, or where the agency action is a mission-critical requirement related to a national security interest or an emergency action. When an agency action is excepted from paragraph (1) because it is in the interest of national security, it is an emergency action, or <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="6427"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-6427" data-page="6427" data-text="Start Printed Page 6427" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 6427}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 6427</span></span></span>it is a mission-critical requirement related to a national security interest or an emergency action, the agency head shall rely on the area of land subject to the base flood”.</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="6427">(j) Section 6 is further amended by adding the following new subsection (d) at the end:</p>
        <p id="p-27" data-page="6427">“(d) The term 'critical action' shall mean any activity for which even a slight chance of flooding would be too great.”.</p>
        <p id="p-28" data-page="6427">(k) Section 8 is revised to read as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-29" data-page="6427">“Nothing in this Order shall apply to assistance provided for emergency work essential to save lives and protect property and public health and safety, performed pursuant to Sections 403 and 502 of the Robert T.
