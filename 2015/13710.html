          <h1 id="h-1">Termination of Emergency With Respect to the Actions and Policies of Former Liberian President Charles Taylor</h1>

          <p id="p-1" data-page="71679">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (NEA), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act, as amended (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=22&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=287&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">22 U.S.C. 287</a>c) (UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="71679">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the situation that gave rise to the declaration of a national emergency in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13348">Executive Order 13348</a> of July 22, 2004, with respect to the actions and policies of former Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property, has been significantly altered by Liberia's significant advances to promote democracy and the orderly development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions, including presidential elections in 2005 and 2011, which were internationally recognized as freely held; the 2012 conviction of, and 50-year prison sentence for, former Liberian President Charles Taylor and the affirmation on appeal of that conviction and sentence; and the diminished ability of those connected to former Liberian President Charles Taylor to undermine Liberia's progress. Accordingly, I hereby terminate the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13348">Executive Order 13348,</a> revoke that order, and further order:</p>
