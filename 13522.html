          <h1 id="h-1">Creating Labor-Management Forums to Improve Delivery of Government Services</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="66203">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish a cooperative and productive form of labor-management relations throughout the executive branch, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="66203">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em>Policy. </em> Federal employees and their union representatives are an essential source of front-line ideas and information about the realities of delivering Government services to the American people. A nonadversarial forum for managers, employees, and employees' union representatives to discuss Government operations will promote satisfactory labor relations and improve the productivity and effectiveness of the Federal Government. Labor-management forums, as complements to the existing collective bargaining process, will allow managers and employees to collaborate in continuing to deliver the highest quality services to the American people. Management should discuss workplace challenges and problems with labor and endeavor to develop solutions jointly, rather than advise union representatives of predetermined solutions to problems and then engage in bargaining over the impact and implementation of the predetermined solutions.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="66203">The purpose of this order is to establish a cooperative and productive form of labor-management relations throughout the executive branch.</p>
