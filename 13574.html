        <p id="p-3" data-page="30505">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong> (a) When the President, or the Secretary of State pursuant to authority delegated by the President and in accordance with the terms of such delegation, which includes consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, has determined that sanctions shall be imposed on a person pursuant to section 5 of ISA and has selected the sanctions set forth in section 6 of ISA to impose on that person, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall take the following actions with respect to the sanctions imposed and maintained by the President or by the Secretary of State pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of such delegation:</p>
        (i) with respect to section 6(a)(3) of ISA, prohibit any United States financial institution from making loans or providing credits to the ISA-sanctioned person consistent with section 6(a)(3) of ISA;
        (ii) with respect to section 6(a)(6) of ISA, prohibit any transactions in foreign exchange that are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and in which the ISA-sanctioned person has any interest;
        (iii) with respect to section 6(a)(7) of ISA, prohibit any transfers of credit or payments between financial institutions or by, through, or to any financial institution, to the extent that such transfers or payments are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and involve any interest of the ISA-sanctioned person;
        (iv) with respect to section 6(a)(8) of ISA, block all property and interests in property that are in the United States, that come within the United States, or that are or come within the possession or control of any United States person, including any overseas branch, of the ISA-sanctioned person, and provide that such property and interests in property may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in; or 
        (v) with respect to section 6(a)(9) of ISA, restrict or prohibit imports of goods, technology, or services, directly or indirectly, into the United States from the ISA-sanctioned person.

        (i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any ISA-sanctioned person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and
        (ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such ISA-sanctioned person.
        <p id="p-13" data-page="30506">(d) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="30506">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="30506">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>

        <p id="p-18" data-page="30506">(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>

        <p id="p-20" data-page="30506">(d) the term “financial institution” includes (i) a depository institution (as defined in section 3(c)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=12&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1813&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">12 U.S.C. 1813</a>(c)(1)), including a branch or agency of a foreign bank (as defined in section 1(b)(7) of the International Banking Act of 1978) (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=12&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=3101&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">12 U.S.C. 3101</a>(7)); (ii) a credit union; (iii) a securities firm, including a broker or dealer; (iv) an insurance company, including an agency or underwriter; and (v) any other company that provides financial services;</p>

          <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 1(a)(iv) of this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/12957">Executive Order 12957,</a> there need be no prior notice of an action taken pursuant to section 1(a)(iv) of this order.</p>

          <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and sections 6(a)(6), 6(a)(7), 6(a)(8), and 6(a)(9) of ISA, and to <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="30507"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-30507" data-page="30507" data-text="Start Printed Page 30507" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 30507}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 30507</span></span></span>employ all powers granted to the United States Government by section 6(a)(3) of ISA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
        <p id="p-25" data-page="30507">
          <strong>Sec. 6.</strong> This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
        <p id="p-26" data-page="30507">
