          <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13833">Executive Order 13833</a> of May 15, 2018
          <h1 id="h-1">Enhancing the Effectiveness of Agency Chief Information Officers</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="23345">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="23345">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Purpose.</em> The Federal Government spends more than $90 billion annually on information technology (IT). The vast majority of this sum is consumed in maintaining legacy IT infrastructure that is often ineffective and more costly than modern technologies. Modern IT systems would enable agencies to reduce costs, mitigate cybersecurity risks, and deliver improved services to the American people. While the recently enacted Modernizing Government Technology Act will provide needed financial resources to help transition agencies to more effective, efficient, and secure technologies, more can be done to improve management of IT resources. Department and agency (agency) Chief Information Officers (CIOs) generally do not have adequate visibility into, or control over, their agencies' IT resources, resulting in duplication, waste, and poor service delivery. Enhancing the effectiveness of agency CIOs will better position agencies to modernize their IT systems, execute IT programs more efficiently, reduce cybersecurity risks, and serve the American people well.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="23345">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of the executive branch to:</p>

          <p id="p-5" data-page="23345">(b) modernize IT infrastructure within the executive branch and meaningfully improve the delivery of digital services; and</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="23345">(c) improve the management, acquisition, and oversight of Federal IT.</p>
