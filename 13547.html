          <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13547">Executive Order 13547</a> of July 19, 2010
          <h1 id="h-1">Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="43023">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="43023">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em>Purpose. </em> The ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes provide jobs, food, energy resources, ecological services, recreation, and tourism opportunities, and play critical roles in our Nation's transportation, economy, and trade, as well as the global mobility of our Armed Forces and the maintenance of international peace and security. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and resulting environmental crisis is a stark reminder of how vulnerable our marine environments are, and how much communities and the Nation rely on healthy and resilient ocean and coastal ecosystems. America's stewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes is intrinsically linked to environmental sustainability, human health and well-being, national prosperity, adaptation to climate and other environmental changes, social justice, international diplomacy, and national and homeland security.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="43023">This order adopts the recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, except where otherwise provided in this order, and directs executive agencies to implement those recommendations under the guidance of a National Ocean Council. Based on those recommendations, this order establishes a national policy to ensure the protection, maintenance, and restoration of the health of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems and resources, enhance the sustainability of ocean and coastal economies, preserve our maritime heritage, support sustainable uses and access, provide for adaptive management to enhance our understanding of and capacity to respond to climate change and ocean acidification, and coordinate with our national security and foreign policy interests.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="43023">This order also provides for the development of coastal and marine spatial plans that build upon and improve existing Federal, State, tribal, local, and regional decisionmaking and planning processes. These regional plans will enable a more integrated, comprehensive, ecosystem-based, flexible, and proactive approach to planning and managing sustainable multiple uses across sectors and improve the conservation of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="43023">
            <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
            <em>Policy. </em> (a) To achieve an America whose stewardship ensures that the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes are healthy and resilient, safe and productive, and understood and treasured so as to promote the well-being, prosperity, and security of present and future generations, it is the policy of the United States to:</p>
          (i) protect, maintain, and restore the health and biological diversity of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems and resources;
          (ii) improve the resiliency of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems, communities, and economies;
          (iii) bolster the conservation and sustainable uses of land in ways that will improve the health of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems;

          (iv) use the best available science and knowledge to inform decisions affecting the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes, and enhance humanity's capacity to understand, respond, and adapt to a changing global environment;<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="43024"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-43024" data-page="43024" data-text="Start Printed Page 43024" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 43024}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 43024</span></span></span>
          
          (v) support sustainable, safe, secure, and productive access to, and uses of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes;
          (vi) respect and preserve our Nation's maritime heritage, including our social, cultural, recreational, and historical values;
          (vii) exercise rights and jurisdiction and perform duties in accordance with applicable international law, including respect for and preservation of navigational rights and freedoms, which are essential for the global economy and international peace and security;
          (viii) increase scientific understanding of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems as part of the global interconnected systems of air, land, ice, and water, including their relationships to humans and their activities;
          (ix) improve our understanding and awareness of changing environmental conditions, trends, and their causes, and of human activities taking place in ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters; and
          (x) foster a public understanding of the value of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes to build a foundation for improved stewardship.
          <p id="p-16" data-page="43024">(b) The United States shall promote this policy by:</p>
          (i) ensuring a comprehensive and collaborative framework for the stewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes that facilitates cohesive actions across the Federal Government, as well as participation of State, tribal, and local authorities, regional governance structures, nongovernmental organizations, the public, and the private sector;
          (ii) cooperating and exercising leadership at the international level;
          (iii) pursuing the United States' accession to the Law of the Sea Convention; and
          (iv) supporting ocean stewardship in a fiscally responsible manner.

            <strong>Sec. 3.</strong>
            <em>Definitions. </em> As used in this order:</p>
          <p id="p-22" data-page="43024">(a) “Final Recommendations” means the <em>Final Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force </em> that shall be made publicly available and for which a notice of public availability shall be published in the <em>Federal Register.</em>

          <p id="p-23" data-page="43024">(b) The term “coastal and marine spatial planning” means a comprehensive, adaptive, integrated, ecosystem-based, and transparent spatial planning process, based on sound science, for analyzing current and anticipated uses of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes areas. Coastal and marine spatial planning identifies areas most suitable for various types or classes of activities in order to reduce conflicts among uses, reduce environmental impacts, facilitate compatible uses, and preserve critical ecosystem services to meet economic, environmental, security, and social objectives. In practical terms, coastal and marine spatial planning provides a public policy process for society to better determine how the ocean, our coasts, and Great Lakes are sustainably used and protected—now and for future generations.</p>
