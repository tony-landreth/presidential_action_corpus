        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13688">Executive Order 13688</a> of January 16, 2015
        <h1 id="h-1">Federal Support for Local Law Enforcement Equipment Acquisition</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="3451">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to better coordinate Federal support for the acquisition of certain Federal equipment by State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies, I hereby order as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="3451">
          <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> For decades, the Federal Government has provided equipment to State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies (LEAs) through excess equipment transfers (including GSA donations), asset forfeiture programs, and Federal grants. These programs have assisted LEAs as they carry out their critical missions to keep the American people safe. The equipment acquired by LEAs through these programs includes administrative equipment, such as office furniture and computers. But it also includes military and military-styled equipment, firearms, and tactical vehicles provided by the Federal Government, including property covered under <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2015/01/22/22-CFR-121">22 CFR part 121</a> and <a class="cfr external" href="/select-citation/2015/01/22/15-CFR-774">15 CFR part 774</a> (collectively, “controlled equipment”).</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="3451">The Federal Government must ensure that careful attention is paid to standardizing procedures governing its provision of controlled equipment and funds for controlled equipment to LEAs. Moreover, more must be done to ensure that LEAs have proper training regarding the appropriate use of controlled equipment, including training on the protection of civil rights and civil liberties, and are aware of their obligations under Federal nondiscrimination laws when accepting such equipment. To this end, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must better coordinate their efforts to operate and oversee these programs.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="3451">
          <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Law Enforcement Equipment Working Group.</em> (a) There is established an interagency Law Enforcement Equipment Working Group (Working Group) to identify agency actions that can improve Federal support for the acquisition of controlled equipment by LEAs, including by providing LEAs with controlled equipment that is appropriate to the needs of their community; ensuring that LEAs are properly trained to employ the controlled equipment they acquire; ensuring that LEAs adopt organizational and operational practices and standards that prevent the misuse or abuse of controlled equipment; and ensuring LEA compliance with civil rights requirements resulting from receipt of Federal financial assistance. The Working Group shall be co-chaired by the Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, and Secretary of Homeland Security. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Working Group shall consist of the following members:</p>
        (i) the Secretary of the Treasury;
        (ii) the Secretary of the Interior;
        (iii) the Secretary of Education;

        (x) providing uniform standards for suspending LEAs from Federal controlled equipment programs for specified violations of law, including civil rights laws, and ensuring those standards are implemented consistently across agencies; and<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="3453"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-3453" data-page="3453" data-text="Start Printed Page 3453" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 3453}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 3453</span></span></span>
