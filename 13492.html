        <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13492">Executive Order 13492</a> of January 22, 2009
        <h1 id="h-1">Review and Disposition of Individuals Detained At the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="4897">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to effect the appropriate disposition of individuals currently detained by the Department of Defense at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base (Guantánamo) and promptly to close detention facilities at Guantánamo, consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice, I hereby order as follows:</p>
        <p id="p-2" data-page="4897">
          <strong>Section 1.</strong>
          <em>Definitions. </em> As used in this order:</p>
        <p id="p-3" data-page="4897">(a)  “Common Article 3” means Article 3 of each of the Geneva Conventions.</p>
        <p id="p-4" data-page="4897">(b)  “Geneva Conventions” means:</p>

        <p id="p-6" data-page="4897">(ii)   the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3217);</p>
        <p id="p-7" data-page="4897">(iii)  the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and</p>
        <p id="p-8" data-page="4897">(iv)   the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3516).</p>
        <p id="p-9" data-page="4897">(c)  “Individuals currently detained at Guantánamo” and “individuals covered by this order” mean individuals currently detained by the Department of Defense in facilities at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base whom the Department of Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants.</p>
        <p id="p-10" data-page="4897">
          <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
          <em>Findings.</em>
        </p>
        <p id="p-11" data-page="4897">(a)  Over the past 7 years, approximately 800 individuals whom the Department of Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants have been detained at Guantánamo.  The Federal Government has moved more than 500 such detainees from Guantánamo, either by returning them to their home country or by releasing or transferring them to a third country.  The Department of Defense has determined that a number of the individuals currently detained at Guantánamo are eligible for such transfer or release.</p>
        <p id="p-12" data-page="4897">(b)  Some individuals currently detained at Guantánamo have been there for more than 6 years, and most have been detained for at least 4 years.  In view of the significant concerns raised by these detentions, both within the United States and internationally, prompt and appropriate disposition of the individuals currently detained at Guantánamo and closure of the facilities in which they are detained would further the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice.  Merely closing the facilities without promptly determining the appropriate disposition of the individuals detained would not adequately serve those interests.  To the extent practicable, the prompt and appropriate disposition of the individuals detained at Guantánamo should precede the closure of the detention facilities at Guantánamo.</p>

        <p id="p-13" data-page="4897">(c)  The individuals currently detained at Guantánamo have the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.  Most of those individuals <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="4898"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-4898" data-page="4898" data-text="Start Printed Page 4898" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 4898}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 4898</span></span></span>have filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal court challenging the lawfulness of their detention.</p>
        <p id="p-14" data-page="4898">(d)  It is in the interests of the United States that the executive branch undertake a prompt and thorough review of the factual and legal bases for the continued detention of all individuals currently held at Guantánamo, and of whether their continued detention is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and in the interests of justice.  The unusual circumstances associated with detentions at Guantánamo require a comprehensive interagency review.</p>
        <p id="p-15" data-page="4898">(e)  New diplomatic efforts may result in an appropriate disposition of a substantial number of individuals currently detained at Guantánamo.</p>
        <p id="p-16" data-page="4898">(f)  Some individuals currently detained at Guantánamo may have committed offenses for which they should be prosecuted.  It is in the interests of the United States to review whether and how any such individuals can and should be prosecuted.</p>
        <p id="p-17" data-page="4898">(g)  It is in the interests of the United States that the executive branch conduct a prompt and thorough review of the circumstances of the individuals currently detained at Guantánamo who have been charged with offenses before military commissions pursuant to the Military Commissions Act of 2006, <a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=109&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=366&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 109-366</a>, as well as of the military commission process more generally.</p>
