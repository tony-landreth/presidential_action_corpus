          <p id="p-2" data-page="39719">I, GEORGE W.

          (i) to have committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing, an act or acts of violence that have the purpose or effect of: 
          (A) threatening the peace or stability of Iraq or the Government of Iraq; or 
          (B) undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq or to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people;

            <strong>Sec. 2.</strong> (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="39720">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="39720">
            <strong>Sec. 3.</strong> For purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="39720">(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-14" data-page="39720">(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and</p>
          <p id="p-15" data-page="39720">(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.</p>
          <p id="p-16" data-page="39720">
            <strong>Sec. 4.</strong> I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1702&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1702</a>(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13303">Executive Order 13303</a> and expanded in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13315">Executive Order 13315,</a> and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 5.</strong> For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13303">Executive Order 13303</a> and expanded in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13315">Executive Order 13315,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this order. </p>

            <strong>Sec. 6.</strong> The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 7.</strong> Nothing in this order is intended to affect the continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other forms of administrative action issued, taken, or continued in effect heretofore or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly terminated, modified, or suspended by or pursuant to this order.</p>
