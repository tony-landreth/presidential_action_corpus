            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em> Principles of the Government-University Partnership.</em> The partnership in science and technology that has evolved between the Federal Government and American universities has yielded benefits that are vital to each. It continues to prove exceptionally productive, successfully promoting the discovery of knowledge, stimulating technological innovation, improving the quality of life, educating and training the next generation of scientists and engineers, and contributing to America's economic prosperity and national security. In order to reaffirm and strengthen this partnership, this order sets forth the following guiding and operating principles that are fully described in the April 1999 National Science and Technology Council report, “Renewing the Government-University Partnership.” These principles shall provide the framework for the development and analysis of all future Federal policies, rules, and regulations for the Federal Government-University research partnership.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="701">(a) The guiding principles that shall govern interactions between the Federal Government and universities that perform research are:</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="701">(1) Research is an investment in the future;</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="701">(2) The integration of research and education is vital;</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="701">(3) Excellence is promoted when investments are guided by merit review; and</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="701">(4) Research must be conducted with integrity.</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="701">(b) The operating principles that shall assist agencies, universities, individual researchers, and auditing and regulatory bodies in implementing the guiding principles are:</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="701">(1) Agency cost-sharing policies and practices must be transparent;</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="701">(2) Partners should respect the merit review process;</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="701">(3) Agencies and universities should manage research in a cost-efficient manner;</p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="701">(4) Accountability and accounting are not the same;</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="701">(5) The benefits of simplicity in policies and practices should be weighed against the costs;</p>
          <p id="p-14" data-page="701">(6) Change should be justified by need and the process made transparent.</p>
          <p id="p-15" data-page="701">(c) Each executive branch department or agency that supports research at universities shall regularly review its existing policies and procedures to ensure that they meet the spirit and intent of the guiding and operating principles stated above.</p>
