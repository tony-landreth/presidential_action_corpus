        <h1 id="h-1">Promoting Agriculture and Rural Prosperity in America</h1>
        <p id="p-1" data-page="20237">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure the informed exercise of regulatory authority that affects agriculture and rural communities, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
