The Intelligence Oversight Board, Amendment to 
                Executive Order 12863

                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
                America, and in order to emphasize the role of the

                branch oversight, it is hereby ordered that Executive 
                Order 12863 is amended as follows:

                Section 1. The text in section 2.1 is deleted and the 
                following text is inserted in lieu thereof: ``The 
                Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB) is hereby 
                established as a standing committee of the PFIAB. The 
                IOB shall consist of no more than four members 
                designated by the President from among the membership 
                of the PFIAB. The Chairman of the PFIAB may also serve 
                as the Chairman or a member of the IOB if so designated 
                by the President. The IOB shall utilize such full-time 
                staff and consultants as authorized by the Chairman of 
                the IOB with the concurrence of the Chairman of the 
                PFIAB.''

                Sec. 2. The first sentence in section 2.3 is deleted 
                and the following sentence is inserted in lieu thereof: 
                ``The IOB shall report to the President.''

                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,

                    December 15, 1997.
