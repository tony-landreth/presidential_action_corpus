President's Advisory Board on Race

                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
                America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 
                as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), and in order to establish a 
                President's Advisory Board on Race, it is hereby 
                ordered as follows:

                Section 1. Establishment. (a) There is established the 
                President's Advisory Board on Race. The Advisory Board 
                shall comprise 7 members from outside the Federal 
                Government to be appointed by the President. Members 
                shall each have substantial experience and expertise in 
                the areas to be considered by the Advisory Board. 
                Members shall be representative of the diverse 
                perspectives in the areas to be considered by the 
                Advisory Board.

                    (b) The President shall designate a Chairperson 
                from among the members of the Advisory Board.

                Sec. 2. Functions. (a) The Advisory Board shall advise 
                the President on matters involving race and racial 
                reconciliation, including ways in which the President 
                can:

                    (1) Promote a constructive national dialogue to 
                confront and work through challenging issues that 
                surround race;
                    (2) Increase the Nation's understanding of our 
                recent history of race relations and the course our 
                Nation is charting on issues of race relations and 
                racial diversity;
                    (3) Bridge racial divides by encouraging leaders in 
                communities throughout the Nation to develop and 
                implement innovative approaches to calming racial 
                tensions;
                    (4) Identify, develop, and implement solutions to 
                problems in areas in which race has a substantial 
                impact, such as education, economic opportunity, 
                housing, health care, and the administration of 
                justice.
                    (b) The Advisory Board also shall advise on such 
                other matters as from time to time the President may 
                refer to the Board.
                    (c) In carrying out its functions, the Advisory 
                Board shall coordinate with the staff of the 
                President's Initiative on Race.

                Sec. 3. Administration. (a) To the extent permitted by 
                law and subject to the availability of appropriations, 
                the Department of Justice shall provide the financial 
                and administrative support for the Advisory Board.

                    (b) The heads of executive agencies shall, to the 
                extent permitted by law, provide to the Advisory Board 
                such information as it may require for the purpose of 
                carrying out its functions.
                    (c) The Chairperson may, from time to time, invite 
                experts to submit information to the Advisory Board and 
                may form subcommittees or working groups within the 
                Advisory Board to review specific matters.
                    (d) Members of the Advisory Board shall serve 
                without compensation but shall be allowed travel 
                expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as 
                authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in 
                the Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707).

                Sec. 4. General. (a) Notwithstanding any other 
                Executive order, the functions of the President under 
                the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, except 
                that of reporting to the Congress, that are applicable 
                to the Advisory Board shall be performed by the 
                Attorney General, or his or her designee,

                in accordance with guidelines that have been issued by 
                the Administrator of General Services.

                    (b) The Advisory Board shall terminate on September 
                30, 1998, unless extended by the President prior to 
                such date.

                    (Presidential Sig.)
