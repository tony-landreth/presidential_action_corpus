                By the authority vested in me as President by the

                America, including S. 342, an Act to extend certain 
                privileges, exemptions, and immunities to Hong Kong 
                Economic and Trade Offices, which I signed into law on 
                June 27, 1997, I hereby extend to the Hong Kong 
                Economic and Trade Offices the privileges, exemptions, 
                and immunities provided by the International 
                Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288 et seq.), 
                and Article I of the Agreement on State and Local

                international agreements or by congressional action.

                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,
