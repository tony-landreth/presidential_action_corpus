          <h1 id="h-1">Creation of the President's Council on Bioethics</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="59851">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="59851">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em> Establishment.</em> There is established the President's Council on Bioethics (the “Council”).</p>

            <strong>Sec. 2.</strong>
            <em> Mission.</em>
          </p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="59851">(a) The Council shall advise the President on bioethical issues that may emerge as a consequence of advances in biomedical science and technology. In connection with its advisory role, the mission of the Council includes the following functions:</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="59851">(1) to undertake fundamental inquiry into the human and moral significance of developments in biomedical and behavioral science and technology;</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="59851">(2) to explore specific ethical and policy questions related to these developments;</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="59851">(3) to provide a forum for a national discussion of bioethical issues;</p>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="59851">(4) to facilitate a greater understanding of bioethical issues; and</p>
          <p id="p-9" data-page="59851">(5) to explore possibilities for useful international collaboration on bioethical issues.</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="59851">(b) In support of its mission, the Council may study ethical issues connected with specific technological activities, such as embryo and stem cell research, assisted reproduction, cloning, uses of knowledge and techniques derived from human genetics or the neurosciences, and end of life issues. The Council may also study broader ethical and social issues not tied to a specific technology, such as questions regarding the protection of human subjects in research, the appropriate uses of biomedical technologies, the moral implications of biomedical technologies, and the consequences of limiting scientific research.</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="59851">(c) The Council shall strive to develop a deep and comprehensive understanding of the issues that it considers. In pursuit of this goal, the Council shall be guided by the need to articulate fully the complex and often competing moral positions on any given issue, rather than by an overriding concern to find consensus. The Council may therefore choose to proceed by offering a variety of views on a particular issue, rather than attempt to reach a single consensus position.</p>
          <p id="p-12" data-page="59851">(d) The Council shall not be responsible for the review and approval of specific projects or for devising and overseeing regulations for specific government agencies.</p>
          <p id="p-13" data-page="59851">(e) In support of its mission, the Council may accept suggestions of issues for consideration from the heads of other Government agencies and other sources, as it deems appropriate.</p>

          <p id="p-14" data-page="59851">(f) In establishing priorities for its activities, the Council shall consider the urgency and gravity of the particular issue; the need for policy guidance and public education on the particular issue; the connection of the bioethical issue to the goal of Federal advancement of science and technology; and the existence of another entity available to deliberate appropriately on the bioethical issue.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59852"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59852" data-page="59852" data-text="Start Printed Page 59852" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 59852}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59852</span></span></span>
