          <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13583">Executive Order 13583</a> of August 18, 2011
          <h1 id="h-1">Establishing a Coordinated Government-Wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="52847">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote the Federal workplace as a model of equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="52847">
            <strong>Section 1.</strong>
            <em>Policy. </em> Our Nation derives strength from the diversity of its population and from its commitment to equal opportunity for all.  We are at our best when we draw on the talents of all parts of our society, and our greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse perspectives are brought to bear to overcome our greatest challenges.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="52847">A commitment to equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion is critical for the Federal Government as an employer.  By law, the Federal Government's recruitment policies should “endeavor to achieve a work force from all segments of society.”  (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=5&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=2301&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">5 U.S.C. 2301</a>(b)(1)).  As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government has a special obligation to lead by example.  Attaining a diverse, qualified workforce is one of the cornerstones of the merit-based civil service.</p>
          <p id="p-4" data-page="52847">Prior Executive Orders, including but not limited to those listed below, have taken a number of steps to address the leadership role and obligations of the Federal Government as an employer.  For example, <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13171">Executive Order 13171</a> of October 12, 2000 (Hispanic Employment in the Federal Government), directed executive departments and agencies to implement programs for recruitment and career development of Hispanic employees and established a mechanism for identifying best practices in doing so.  <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13518">Executive Order 13518</a> of November 9, 2009 (Employment of Veterans in the Federal Government), required the establishment of a Veterans Employment Initiative.  <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13548">Executive Order 13548</a> of July 26, 2010 (Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities), and its related predecessors, <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13163">Executive Order 13163</a> of July 26, 2000 (Increasing the Opportunity for Individuals With Disabilities to be Employed in the Federal Government), and <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13078">Executive Order 13078</a> of March 13, 1998 (Increasing Employment of Adults With Disabilities), sought to tap the skills of the millions of Americans living with disabilities.</p>
          <p id="p-5" data-page="52847">To realize more fully the goal of using the talents of all segments of society, the Federal Government must continue to challenge itself to enhance its ability to recruit, hire, promote, and retain a more diverse workforce.  Further, the Federal Government must create a culture that encourages collaboration, flexibility, and fairness to enable individuals to participate to their full potential.</p>

          <p id="p-6" data-page="52847">Wherever possible, the Federal Government must also seek to consolidate compliance efforts established through related or overlapping statutory mandates, directions from Executive Orders, and regulatory requirements.  By this order, I am directing executive departments and agencies (agencies) to develop and implement a more comprehensive, integrated, and strategic focus on diversity and inclusion as a key component of their human resources strategies.  This approach should include a continuing effort to identify and adopt best practices, implemented in an integrated manner, to promote diversity and remove barriers to equal employment opportunity, consistent with merit system principles and applicable law.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="52848"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-52848" data-page="52848" data-text="Start Printed Page 52848" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data='{"page": 52848}'><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 52848</span></span></span>
