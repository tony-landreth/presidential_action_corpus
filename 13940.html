          <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13940">Executive Order 13940</a> of August 3, 2020
          <h1 id="h-1">Aligning Federal Contracting and Hiring Practices With the Interests of American Workers</h1>
          <p id="p-1" data-page="47879">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="47879">
            <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Policy.</em> It is the policy of the executive branch to create opportunities for United States workers to compete for jobs, including jobs created through Federal contracts. These opportunities, particularly in regions where the Federal Government remains the largest employer, are especially critical during the economic dislocation caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. When employers trade American jobs for temporary foreign labor, for example, it reduces opportunities for United States workers in a manner inconsistent with the role guest-worker programs are meant to play in the Nation's economy.</p>
          <p id="p-3" data-page="47879">
            <strong>Sec. 2</strong>. <em>Review of Contracting and Hiring Practices.</em> (a) The head of each executive department and agency (agency) that enters into contracts shall review, to the extent practicable, performance of contracts (including subcontracts) awarded by the agency in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to assess:</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-4" data-page="47879">(i) whether contractors (including subcontractors) used temporary foreign labor for contracts performed in the United States, and, if so, the nature of the work performed by temporary foreign labor on such contracts; whether opportunities for United States workers were affected by such hiring; and any potential effects on the national security caused by such hiring; and</p>
          <p class="flush-paragraph flush-paragraph-1 flush-left" id="p-5" data-page="47879">(ii) whether contractors (including subcontractors) performed in foreign countries services previously performed in the United States, and, if so, whether opportunities for United States workers were affected by such offshoring; whether affected United States workers were eligible for assistance under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program authorized by the Trade Act of 1974; and any potential effects on the national security caused by such offshoring.</p>
          <p id="p-6" data-page="47879">(b) The head of each agency that enters into contracts shall assess any negative impact of contractors' and subcontractors' temporary foreign labor hiring practices or offshoring practices on the economy and efficiency of Federal procurement and on the national security, and propose action, if necessary and as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to improve the economy and efficiency of Federal procurement and protect the national security.</p>
          <p id="p-7" data-page="47879">(c) The head of each agency shall, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, review the employment policies of the agency to assess the agency's compliance with Executive Order 11935 of September 2, 1976 (Citizenship Requirements for Federal Employment), and section 704 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, <a class="publ external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/93?link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 116-93</a>.</p>

            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. <em>Measures to Prevent Adverse Effects on United States Workers.</em> Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretaries of Labor and Homeland Security shall take action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to protect United States workers from any adverse effects on wages and working conditions caused by the employment of H-1B visa holders at job sites (including third-party job sites), including measures to ensure that all employers of H-1B visa holders, including secondary employers, adhere to the requirements of section 212(n)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/8/1182?type=usc&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1182</a>(n)(1)).</p>
