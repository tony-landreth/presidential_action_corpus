          <p id="p-1" data-page="14943">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1701&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1701</a> <em>et seq.</em>) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=50&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1601&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">50 U.S.C. 1601</a> <em>et seq.</em>), the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=22&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=287&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">22 U.S.C. 287</a>c) (UNPA), the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=114&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=122&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Public Law 114-122</a>), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=8&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1182&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">8 U.S.C. 1182</a>(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2270 of March 2, 2016,</p>
          <p id="p-2" data-page="14943">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the Government of North Korea's continuing pursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced most recently by its February 7, 2016, launch using ballistic missile technology and its January 6, 2016, nuclear test in violation of its obligations pursuant to numerous UNSCRs and in contravention of its commitments under the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, increasingly imperils the United States and its allies. To address those actions, and to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466</a> of June 26, 2008, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent Executive Orders, I hereby order:</p>

          <p id="p-16" data-page="14944">
            <strong>Sec. 3</strong>. (a) The following are prohibited:</p>
          (i) the exportation or reexportation, direct or indirect, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of any goods, services, or technology to North Korea;

            <strong>Sec. 4</strong>. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in subsection 2(a) of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).</p>

          <p id="p-23" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 6</strong>. The prohibitions in sections 1 and 2 of this order include but are not limited to:</p>

          <p id="p-25" data-page="14945">(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p>
          <p id="p-26" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 7</strong>. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-27" data-page="14945">(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p>
          <p id="p-28" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 8</strong>. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations (including its specialized agencies, programmes, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.</p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 9</strong>. For the purposes of this order:</p>
          <p id="p-30" data-page="14945">(a) the term “person” means an individual or entity;</p>
          <p id="p-31" data-page="14945">(b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p>
          <p id="p-32" data-page="14945">(c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and</p>
          <p id="p-33" data-page="14945">(d) the term “Government of North Korea” means the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities.</p>
          <p id="p-34" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 10</strong>. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in <a class="eo" href="/executive-order/13466">Executive Order 13466,</a> there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 or 2 of this order.</p>
          <p id="p-35" data-page="14945">
            <strong>Sec. 11</strong>. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and the UNPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
