          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288) (the “Act”), and having found that the Council of Europe in Respect of the Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO) is a public international organization in which the United States participates within the meaning of the Act, I hereby designate GRECO as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the Act.
